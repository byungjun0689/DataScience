49108,Very poor product!,YVONNE BOWDEN,R27E8KSLJMUQZV,"I would advise you not purchase this product.  I bought three of them for my grandchildren, and they are all a problem.  The screen blacks out, chargers don't work, and if you do get it charged, it lasts for maybe 45 minutes.  If it was jus one of them, maybe just a defective item, but all three are bad.",1/16/14,0
14575,Love the Thribe just not this one,SBF making her own choices,RWH612Z95Q8QX,"I had to return this product. the great price was because it was poorly refurbished. Ended up returning and buying from another merchant. Great buy so much better than the i-anything. External storage, can be connected to my tv using only an HDMI cable, my grandson finds it so easy to operate, great at church and at work.",1/17/14,0

120889,"Way over price, old OS",Tione,R2Y07M1IU3RTP6,"This device is way over price and it doesn't even have the latest OS, Kit Kat. Samsung takes way too long to release the new software update, battery life is not good and should I mention again that it's way over priced.",1/20/14,0
85521,Expectations set too high,Jack Unangst,R2Z7X9MJVB08YI,"This was bought for me, Jack's wife, for a recent cruise and to continue its use for banking, reading, Sudoku and games when we travel.  I am surprised that I have to buy most reading material, it is not easy to navigate around, and I bought a cover that Best Buy promised would turn the Kindle Fire off when the cover was closed.  That did not occur on the cruise and I am being charged $216.45 for it constantly running even though it was closed and stowed in my luggage.  I bought minutes onboard so I could check my emails and the day I opened it we had received a contract on our house so I was glad I had overpaid onboard ship for the service but never expected to be charged beyond the minutes I had bought.  There seems to be signs that this Kindle Fire was previously owned.  I have found another's email address in it.  Not sure I am happy with it and wonder what your return policy is?  Thank you, Thelma Unangst",1/29/14,0
71838,"my brand new Kindle Fire HDX 7, didn't work. My replacement SECOND KINDLE , worked better, but I had problems.",Amazon Customer,RWAQBKRLU5FLH,I am bummed by this new Kindle. It was defective. It wouldn't stay connected to the internet. I talked with the kindle support and they helped we check it out but ultimately they told me to send it back and they sent me a new one 2 days later. Customer service gets a 10 in my book. The battery runs down to fast.I received my replacement Kindle Fire.  I really like the display and functionality but I don't understand why I should have to turn it off several times a day and clear applications of previous content in order to keep it connected to the WiFi.I couldn't tolerate the inconvenience of restarting the device over and over. Customer service is excellent. I chose to send this back within my return period so I could get a refund of my purchase price.  I really like Amazon and I appreciate shopping through them. I do not like to give negative comments. I am  generally a satisfied customer.Personally I feel this Kindle needs to be upgraded to work without these difficulties.I purchased a Samsung Note 8 and it is performing perfectly. I got the Kindle app and am enjoying my books and a whole lot more. The difference is remarkable.,1/4/14,0
110019,Waste of my money,Tracey M. Torreyson,R1O2OIT6WD450M,"Both my sons have one of these tablets and I absolutely don't like them! The battery on these things can be 90% or more and the thing turns off on them while they are playing a game or reading (and it does it QUITE often) and won't turn back on unless you plug the thing in. And when it is working, it runs slow. For $150.00 a pop, I think these tablets could have been better quality. For their birthdays this year I will be replacing them with the Kindle Fire. Good thing I hadn't bought one for my daughter yet!",1/22/14,0
107375,Device ran once and then died,Jaspreet Singh,R1KCG7PU77M7X2,I played around with it for a bit. It ran a couple of hours very nicely. Seemed great value for money.But then I put it to charge and it died to never wake up. I let it charge for a few days but nothing happened and I had to return it.,1/6/14,0
109846,Horrible product:,Adriana Rosado,R2ATB250BK16CC,"I am very disappointed with this product completely,it never fully charged and now it only works while plugged to the wall (not what i bought it for) which doesn't allow me to move,wish i could return it because i am very upset and wouldn't recommend this to anybody.",1/6/14,0
97853,Only good for kids.  Can't run apps from the Google Store.,R. Singer,R1LPEI1JA1F4NS,"Amazed to learn that Amazon prevents you from loading apps from the Google Store.  To my knowledge, Amazon's are the only Android devices that do that.  Instead, you can only load apps from Amazon.  There are dramatically less apps in Amazon's store than Googles.  All of the business and art apps that I use on my phone are not in the Amazon store.Other than that, this makes a great toy for a kid.  Toy because even the educational app selection is limited.I don't understand why more people aren't complaining about this.  I'm guessing they don't realize what they're missing.",1/14/14,0

118799,"Screen pops off, can't get any free apps!",leah7195,R6WA20IIQCXLZ,"I bought this for my 18 yr old daughter for Christmas. Her and her boyfriend had it out of it's box for about 2 hours when the screen popped out of place...reallly! It's not like they are 10 and mishandling it! They also could not get but a few apps that they really wanted. The OS doesn't support very many of the popular apps.I had read the reviews on this product and some said the screen popped off but I ignored them thinking that an 18 yr old could take care of it. So I bought it anyway, thinking I would get a decent tablet for a bargain price. You really can't skimp if you want good quality. It even looks cheap.I returned it and ended up buying her another popular brand on sale for $60 more than what I paid for the Dragon, but it was worth it because she loves it!",1/18/14,0
22840,Not worth the money,"jpdingdong ""Jon P.""",R37UXGSDD771B7,"I've had my prime for several years. Had I know what a nightmare their customer services is, I would never have bought the unit. The camera died and it took two months to get this thing back only after contacting their HQ in Taiwan. The customer support line people are reading scripts like little robots and are not allowed to contact the people who actually fix the units directly. They also make you pay for shipping.Also, the cheap plastic on the USB cable literally fell off and they refused to replace it. Had this been Apple customer services, they would have replaced it and given me a $20 for iTunes.Wireless performance is very poor, GPS ended up in Asus loosing a class action lawsuit and scrolling is very jerky. Overall, a catastrophic and expensive customer experience.",1/7/14,0
110035,Waste of $200,"Patrick D. Craft ""Patrick Craft""",R358QIXI5FFBD8,"I bought this for my 7 year old who loves games and electronics. Comes with its own Kurio app store which is worthless and also has a few others you can install, amazon app being the only one worth using. One of the app stores had a porn app on it. This is suppose to be a family friendly tablet. The Kurio runs on a Android platform but is not approved by Google to run Google Play app store. Save your money and buy a tablet manufactured by a reputable company.",1/7/14,0
89709,Problems with kindle fire from the start,Mr. Mustache,RERBC9M7LD4GO,"I got my kindle fire for Christmas and have had problems from the start. At first it wouldn't charge fully (81%). Then shortly after that it would fully charge at 66%, then 49%. So now, after owning it for barely a month it won't hold a charge at all. I know it's plugged in correctly as the charge symbol appears, but now my kindle won't even power on. So frustrating! It works great when on and I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for this",1/28/14,0
110027,Completely died after 2 weeks.,L,R4EK2IWY7F1RM,"Got this from TRU for my daughter's birthday. She loved it -- until it completely died on her 2 weeks later and was an inconsolable wreck. She thought her pet cat (one of the apps, apparently) was dead, too. Great. Thanks, Kurio. Returned it and got the Samsung Galaxy Tab instead.",1/15/14,0
121994,NO SO MUCH,Stacey,RXOIEFD37ULKC,"Okay, listen, I bought these after I bought my kids their tablets (At Walmart - 59$) for Christmas.  I spent $88.00 on these and the picture quality just isn't there.  You seem to have to struggle to see what is on the screen.  Just not a fan for everything this thing say it has, it really doesn't seem like it.",1/11/14,0

55745,Barely worked and then died,"Maurice J. Halmos ""Maurice""",RVMNSHVSJATZJ,"I received this product, and the touch screen was very erratic.  Had it replaced, and still was a bit erratic, I believe that the screen protector made it really bad, and without it it worked somewhat OK.  The battery life was never too good, maybe 1-2 hours.Soon, the device would only work if plugged in, and later even that didn't work.  I only used the tablet occasionally maybe once or twice a month. The warranty has run out, so I learned how bad a cheap tablet can really be.  I would not recommend this tablet for anyone who doesn't enjoy total frustration.",1/3/14,0
107998,STOPPED WORKING AMAZON RETURN POLICY EXPIRED,Karen Vargas,R1T8MJEPDDMHDC,"This product was a huge disappointment, ordered form my son as a christmas gift. I read previous reviews all good.

Ordered from Amazon but because I live in Sweden it was shipped from America. Arrived on time, looked stunning, plugged it in and, nothing wouldn't charge blank screen, dead.  Gutted, spoilt my day. Sent back to the states about three weeks ago, haven't heard a thing yet. No email, no apology no explanation. Enough said I think. Anthony Harvey, a disappointed customer",1/17/14,0

3515,Good means defective,Mac,R2AQVOCLBNOQUM,"I was looking for a iPad just to use at home on WiFi --news etc. Limited budget etc.Cellular Stream had what was described as a ""good""  iPad. No mention of the many defects that made the item unuseable.I am embarressed for Apple and Amazon. Perhaps they should vet their vendors before they put their Brands at risk.",1/4/14,0
44691,Not what I expected,"SQL, UNIX, Rams, Cavaliers ""Mmm... Beer.""",RY0OKKORA6NRX,"I received this as a holiday gift. The cool factor of having (another) tablet did not last more than a day for a few reasons. I love Android OS.The most frustrating feature of the Kindle is the on board web browser Silk. It is clumsy and does not offer advanced privacy options. This is my paramount desire. Alternating between the Amazon accelerated/encrypted browsing off and on, several of the websites I visit most are slow. I am looking at a very popular sport team's fan site, which was claimed to have been optimized for most modern browsers. The text forums take over a minute to load and scrolling is disjointed and clunky. Every time I exit silk, I must remember to delete all temporary files, settings, and passwords as I do not trust storing them, or the cookies and silk contains no setting to automatically browse ""in private"" (even though even with Firefox that is a misnomer, and other precautions should be taken).The Amazon app store is equally clumsy. Try searching for a specific item. I was looking for Final Fantasy games, and results ended up with items that obviously were not what I was searching for. There aren't enough controls or oversight on the content available, and it is hard to determine if the software (app) you are considering is what you actually desire. As much as I hate Apple, I do also have an IPad and, as much as I loathe DRM, Apple's presentation is much more polished. Both could stand slight updates in allowing additional advanced search options in regards to their respective digital store fronts. If I can't tell if the results from my search are a word document, a picture, a video, or a game then there is a very big problem.This introduces a criticism where these two issues merge: The app store does not currently offer any other reputable web browser options. Silk is terrrrrible, and Mozilla products are tagged as not currently available. After some quick internet searching, I figured out how to get on the beta releases for one of the more popular browser options that gives the end user more control. I have yet to be able to devote the time necessary to make it fully compatible with my needs; flash is not readily available and my web browsing is limited as a result. I still have to use Silk if I want to watch YouTube.What I actually want in a tablet is something that gives me control over my product, without challenging me to change it without voiding the warranty. I want to be able to change the wallpaper. I do not want to see an advertisement every time I pick it up; in all likelihood, I am probably not going to buy the junk you are trying to sell to me. I can't stand the carousel. Every time I finish with something I remove it from the home screen. If someone truly enjoys that type of file management assistance, they should go with an MS product. The constant monitoring Amazon does on the device limits the performance of the hardware, and robs resources that would otherwise enhance performance. Pass on this. I think the only way I will get what I want is if I build it myself, or root something with the hardware I need.Edit: I forgot to mention charging, which took 10 hours to go from 3% to 100%. I also managed to get to 14% from 100%, while being connected to the charger which came with the device.",1/28/14,0
23554,Horrible Product,sarahhop2,R20DXZCK5B7RW5,"We purchased a Le Pan tablet in December 2012. In July of 2013, the tablet would no longer charge so eventually wouldn't even turn on. At that time, I contacted Le Pan and they sent a brand new replacement tablet. Last week, the graphics on the replacement tablet became completely jumbled and discolored. I contacted Le Pan once again, went through all of their troubleshooting steps however nothing fixed it. I have been told today that only the original tablet was warrantied and because the warranty on the original tablet expired in December of 2013, they will not fix or replace our current tablet. These are terrible products.",1/23/14,0
118328,Very Disappointed.,Kim J Bucher-Tyo,R3RX68OEZSDUJ7,"Bought three of them for our Grandchildren for Christmas.  I charged all of them for the full 10 hours that was recommended before I gave them to them.  One would not turn on at all.  The second would not turn on after the first week of use.  The third is still working, but who knows for how long.  Not overly optimistic.  I loved the color choices",1/10/14,0
30270,yeech worst product ever,Wayde Ramnarine,R10PIQLJYS6TN5,nothing works with this. the O/S is a hot mess. froze up repeatedly when I tried to do the recommended updates and I had to use some unknown app source - did not support google play apps. I eventually threw it away in frustration.,1/7/14,0
119600,"IPAD AIR unusable, tech support is worthless.",Dr. Sarah M. Young,R11CXF8RPTZQJW,I purchased the IPAD air last week. When I tried to activate my accounts it would not allow it because apparently since I changed carriers I could not use my old Apple ID because it is tied to the old carrier. I can't establish a new Apple ID because I have an old one and if they delete the old one I lose all the apps I've paid for. I contacted Apple Technical where I was required to purchase tech support before they would do anything.  After doing this I went through multiple calls with multiple levels of support over three days so far with more to come. Seems that if the tech makes a mistake it stops the process and you have to wait 24 hours for them to be able to continue. They promise to call back and so far they have not so I called them to start the frustrating cycle all over again. I can't get the apps I want until this if fixed. I also can't connect to Facebook. For a machine this expensive plus having to pay for tech support for something that is Apple's fault I now believe Apple products aren't worth the gas to go buy one. I've been using Apples since the Apple Plus and I feel abused as a customer for the IPAD AIR. On top of all this they just had the gall to send me an email thanking me for contacting Apple Support. They have charged me for something a user should be able to do online with a new machine that is supposed to be the latest and greatest and it is just a paper weight right now. Can't return it because there is nothing wrong with it. Seems to me Apple is unethical and does not care about customers after a purchase. Dr. Sarah young,1/26/14,0

The whole app just blows up!CRASHES TO THE MAX!Crashes almost EVERY app!The menu at the bottom always seems DEAD because it ALWAYS CRASHES!A good tablet for six month old baby, yeah. But me? No way.I couldn't believe how upset this thing actually made me. I tried so hard to make it work, and it just didn't. I had it since August, I put up with it for that long. It's obvious, that just because it's cheap, doesn't mean it's good. (But I refuse to buy an iPad, worth the same amount as a BRAND NEW desktop PC!)I pressed debug and it no longer connects to the computer, refuses to sync sometimes, if syncing was ever good. So, I had to factory reset the whole thing. Oh, yeah. And when you press Factory Reset, it won't reset! You have to download some other software just to get it to reset itself! So, yeah, I reset it. It took all my apps with it. NO problem, because I backed up the entire thing. I click restore on the backup, asks for password. NO PROBLEM. I set one earlier. And then suddenly, THAT AIN'T THE RIGHT PASSWORD! AND, just to kick more sand in my eyes, there is NO password recovery! So, I had to re-install all the apps all over again! I tried so hard NOT to get upset! AND I DIDN'T! I wanted to LIKE this thing!Oh, yeah! There's more!So, life's good, for now, as I sit here trying to cope with the lost of all my apps. I'm so scared to download anything, all I do is download three apps. MY other siblings have them, so I know they aren't bad apps! Suddenly, the whole tablet shuts down when I try to disable the sound on the Google keyboard. I turn the STUPID thing back on it starts to tell me it's encrypting! I didn't set it to encrypt! I wasn't even IN the security settings (I was in the LANGUAGE AND INPUT settings!) So, of course, I shut it back off. I turn it back on it shoots me something like, ""Encryption was a failure, your tablet is no longer accessible. You HAVE to factory reset."" Of course, I didn't want to, but I honestly CAN NOT do anything else unless I reset it! OF COURSE I'm mad as you know what! Of course I WANT to return it! BUT (OF COURSE) I CAN NOT return it because it's WAY past 30 days over due!IF this thing was trying to give me a heart attack, it ALMOST worked! ALMOST! But I can tell you this, it AIN'T Android! MY whole family has Android tablets! And not ONCE have I heard them complain about theirs! I just don't have the slightest CLUE why they would make such a product like this, KNOWING all their other ones are okay! Maybe it's just me! But I doubt it since I've grown up with electronics, and half of my family have COLLEGE EXPERIENCE in electronics AND software INCLUDING me!The sad part? I bought this tablet to use for college to take NOTES! I should have known when it couldn't even handle note taking it was a dud!So, If I could give it zero stars, or even throw it back to their facility, then I would!DO NOT BUY THIS!

Third, they would power off at random while using them and sometimes they were hard to power on after charging.  Also it took forever to download new apps.

The blue line was annoying and waiting for it to reach the end made looking on the internet less enjoyable. I couldn't watch youtube or anything else without having to deal with that line waiting an eternity to move. There are times when it freezes and I have to start over or those messages that pop up saying that the program has timed out. The plug was also a problem when charging and struggling to keep it on was ridiculous. This machine was a complete nightmare and I was glad to get rid of it.,1/16/14,0
87210,Blue/Purple Haze- Very disappointing,Traditionalist,R3MYSGFEO4PDI6,"Amazon has disclosed the fact that the blue LED attribute of the HDX 7"" creates a blue/purple haze around the edges of white reading pages and white web pages. While this blue LED attribute may provide true colors for movies, games, photos, etc., it is most distracting and disturbing to readers. I have an older 32GB Fire HD, and the reading light has none of this blue/purple tinge. Before ordering this unit, I contacted customer service and was told that the problem existed only on a small number of units, and that I could replace the unit if the problem occurred. When I received the unit, the problem was very apparent, and I have decided to simply return the unit and order the newer Kindle Fire HD 7"", which uses white light LED. I would have preferred to replace it with my older generation Kindle Fire HD 7"", a more enhanced unit, but Amazon no longer sells that model. Since first writing this review I have received the newer Kindle Fire HD 16gb, and there is no blue haze on the unit. I do not miss the camera, microphone, and auto adjust brightness features. So, for $184 for the HD vs. $254 (with $30 deal)on the HDX, I believe I have come out ahead and ultimately purchased the model that is right for me.",1/23/14,0

114465,Specs On Paper Does Not Match Performance.,G. Davis,R1UGCDYLBV57D3,"I received my Latte iMuz Q9 Android 4.2 9.7"" XHD IPS screen quad core tablet on Jan 3, 2014. Let me say that Amazon shipping service is great! The table looked great; it came in a nice professional package. However, the specs that look good on paper doesn't perform well in reality. Let me start with the Tablet itself. It almost looked like an Ipad with exception of the metal back plate (which I thought looked cool). It was your typical built tablet like any other brand when it came to the materials. Next the screen, I will have to say the screen was nice indeed though the brightness control was very poor. The camera was terrible. I know that is not the main reason why we get a tablet but it should be working properly and take great pics. I found the pics and the videos to be grainy and was very poor quality. I did not like the fact it came with a charger instead of charging it through the USB port. It isn't a deal breaker, but it is just more stuff to carry with you if you plan on traveling. The videos from Netflix and HBOGo ran choppy. It should have been smoothed considering the hardware inside. It did come installed with Google Play so that was a plus. When flicking between screens, it seemed like you have to flick quick to get the screen moving. I was real excited when it came in but was disappointed. Even worse, after 30 minutes of play time with it, I could never get it to come back on. I have already sent it back to Amazon for a refund. If you are looking to root or whatever, it is best to move on to something that is more familiar to electronic consumers. This tablet had potential but just couldn't reach the mark.",1/6/14,0

107945,Stop working after 2 months,"JTW ""jtw""",RGJ3F6EV2O7CL,"I know there is always a chance, every now and then, of getting the ""dud"" when purchasing electronics.  Unfortunately, this particular tablet was a dud.  After 2 months of very minimal use, it just stopped working; wouldn't even come on.  When it was working, still wasn't impressed.  It had some software glitches and the ""feel"" of the tablet itself was very cheap.  The power/wake-up/sleep button is in a very odd place:  it's on the back-right of the tablet which made its use somewhat difficult and was a nuisance.  I suggest spending a few $$$ more and getting a more reputable brand.",1/5/14,0

73132,Free Time App is MUCH less useful than we thought...,"Amazon Customer ""Jessica Donahoe""",R2UYIRTWRGNB8P,"There are plenty of reviews for the kindle itself. This review is specifically for parents hoping to use the free time app, which is the specific reason why we bought this kindle. (we already have two others)First, the app is not intuitive at all. I see no reason to make it so difficult to navigate. I can never figure out where I am or where I need to go and find myself having to log in all over again while trying to navigate it.Second, there is no way to control content under the amazon free time subscription. We chose NOT to use this app, because it means giving content control over to Amazon, and we don't necessarily agree with them on what is good content for our child. They include things we would not and leave out things our child would like that we find acceptable for him.Third, even if you have a prime account, you cannot stream free video content within the free time app unless you pay for the subscription to use the content amazon has chosen. Within the free time app, you must purchase and download any vidoes your kid wants to watch.Fourth (this is minor compared to the other three, but still an issue for us), it would be nice if there was an option for reading time vs other time. Right now we have to set individual app and video times. We'd like him to be able to choose either for the full amount of time. Not that he often will, but we'd love for him to be able to choose educational apps for his full allotment of time. Also, a lot of apps have videos, and netflix ends up being an app, so the line between apps & videos is blurred anyway.If you are a parent who thinks this will make managing time with electronics easier, think again.",1/18/14,0

I purchased this tablet with the hopes of using it as a desktop replacement - and using with a keyboard and/or mouse. Any/all Bluetooth devices drop on this tablet.  I have upgraded it to version 4.3 .  Doing a search on the internet reveals this is a systemic issue for the 2014 model. When calling Samsung tech support, they claim not to know it is an issue - however, they will tell you it is a software issue and to 'wait for the update.'  They cannot provide any time for the update...and aren't the ones publishing it.  Too bad - this thing is a nice product otherwise.  I will comment that my Bluetooth devices work well with my Galaxy S4 and other Android Devices.**UPDATE **After speaking with Samsung customer service, they continue to deny there is a problem with the 2014 units.  However, per the customer service rep, Samsung pulled their planned Bluetooth keyboard (he saw it in Beta) - and commented it was quite unusual for Samsung not to have released a keyboard by now.  I published a negative review on the Samsung website about this issue - only to have it pulled from the site.  Shame Shame Samsung for releasing a product with a defect like NO reliable Bluetooth for key'd & mouse. I also am not sure I can attribute this is an Android issue - I have other 4.3 devices *namely a 7"" Nexus tablet* running 4.3.  And that unit works GREAT with various Bluetooth keyboards + mice.

117292,"IPAD AIR unusable, tech support is worthless.",Dr. Sarah M. Young,R11CXF8RPTZQJW,I purchased the IPAD air last week. When I tried to activate my accounts it would not allow it because apparently since I changed carriers I could not use my old Apple ID because it is tied to the old carrier. I can't establish a new Apple ID because I have an old one and if they delete the old one I lose all the apps I've paid for. I contacted Apple Technical where I was required to purchase tech support before they would do anything.  After doing this I went through multiple calls with multiple levels of support over three days so far with more to come. Seems that if the tech makes a mistake it stops the process and you have to wait 24 hours for them to be able to continue. They promise to call back and so far they have not so I called them to start the frustrating cycle all over again. I can't get the apps I want until this if fixed. I also can't connect to Facebook. For a machine this expensive plus having to pay for tech support for something that is Apple's fault I now believe Apple products aren't worth the gas to go buy one. I've been using Apples since the Apple Plus and I feel abused as a customer for the IPAD AIR. On top of all this they just had the gall to send me an email thanking me for contacting Apple Support. They have charged me for something a user should be able to do online with a new machine that is supposed to be the latest and greatest and it is just a paper weight right now. Can't return it because there is nothing wrong with it. Seems to me Apple is unethical and does not care about customers after a purchase. Dr. Sarah young,1/26/14,0

I thought I had done something wrong at first maybe I didn't plug it in right or something. It got worse over time so I reset it, I bought a new cord everything I could think of, nothing worked and it got to the point i could not get it to charge at all. I researched it online to find out this is a VERY common problem, a design flaw. Of course by this time my warranty expired, guess i wasted too much time trying to find a quick fix. Well customer service will replace with a re-manufactured one for the same price I could purchase a NEW one on sale. I would then be paying a total of $280.00 for a 1st Generation Kindle Fire. I think since it is a design defect (the charging port is only held in place by solder on the board, nothing else) it should be taken care of just like a recall on a car defect. I was planning on buying the new HDX but now am seriously reconsidering. Buy the extended warranty!!",1/5/14,0
113421,Cost too much for what you get,Princess,RF6Q8TQU6H7UB,I purchased this for a Christmas gift and first of all the charger didn't work  --- or so I thought.  One of the keys on the keyboard was loose from the beginning and kept falling out.  A week later the entire tablet wouldn't charge and I think it is in the tablet itself maybe the charge port because no charger would get it to turn on.  I put precious and priceless videos and pictures on it and now I had to send it back.  I was told that maybe the manufacturers in CHINA may be able to retrieve the photos and videos - MAYBE.  This was not a good experience for me!,1/14/14,0

108074,Power Issues and now dead,Jason L,R3AGRB9RMXJS9D,I have two of these tablets and the more recent purchase is now dead five weeks later.  Both have issues of not turning on easy at seemingly random times.  Even with a charged battery there are times when I have had to plug the tablet into my laptop then hold the power button for a few minutes at a time to get it to turn on. The tablet now has not been functional for a few days and is basically a paperweight now.Update March 2014: The other tablet now has a loose micro USB port and is darn near impossible to charge.  That is a definite 0 for 2 on these now.,2/23/14,0
29493,The flimsiest smart device I've ever owned.,Fey,R1ER3C04YCFJO,"I told myself I'd never buy an apple, but my school had a sale on this model and I was in some need of a tablet for school, so I grabbed one of these.  Cut to two weeks later, I'm eating with a group of friends and pass an empty cup over the iPad, in its case, and it falls the three inches down to the device. An empty, plastic cup. Three inches. And the glass around the button shatters like satan himself hit it with a hammer. I will never purchase an apple product again.

Upon research, this is a common problem when putting the phone version on a tablet. To fix the issue you have to Root the tablet, and being it's a China tablet, probably not wise as it's almost guranteed to brick it. Save up and get a Kindle etc.",2/25/14,0

I knew another girl with a kindle fire, and figured out it was a common problem and they would exchange it for a new one. I exchanged it, and once again, within less than half a year, I rarely get it to charge. Sometimes I go days without using it, not for lack of uses, but because I have given up trying to charge.

110763,The wifi works when it wants to.. who needs that garbage?,"miss-honesty ""Tiffany""",R23K9TCQD2695B,"I ordered this mid-December in time for Christmas for my mother. She lugs around the laptop and was having trouble carrying it. Her computing needs could be covered by this tablet so I purchased it. For under two hundred dollars, the reviews looked favorable enough I decided on this relatively unknown brand. Her eyes aren't that good so I needed to get her the ten inch tablet versus a seven inch one. It's unfortunate because for that same money a good brand could have been procured in 7''.At first, I was pleased with myself. She loved it. The HD display is nice, the weight is on point and it did everything she needed it to do. The camera has a very low resolution and that was initially all I disliked about it. Now it is hardly February and she's having wireless issues. Mainly, the internet will work on one day and not on another. How is she supposed to cope with that? I've tried working it upstairs, and downstairs when it's within several feet of the router. This router can operate two laptops and a phone without problems. I tried using this tablet with ONLY the Matricom requesting internet. No dice. I just looked into my orders to return it thinking I'd try out another tablet to see if this was merely some hardware fault in her particular one. My window expired TWO days ago. I now plan on buying a more reliable brand like Asus or Samsung and I'll be the proud owner of this secondhand paperweight. Thanks, Matricom. I'll remember that I shouldn't roll the dice on electronics.My advice? Stick to a brand you've already tried and found to be true. The knock-offs can really burn you. This is by far my worst purchase in years of Amazon. I'd better go get some ICE for this BURN.",2/2/14,0
97851,Frozen Hell,Mookie,R3C97HA7B0T4FG,"I've had my Kindle HDX for a month and it froze four times so far.  I have to let it power down since it won't shut off using the off button.  After recharging it, I used the Mayday button and they told me that it may have overheated and that I should do a hard reboot (hold the off button for twenty seconds).  It happened again but figured that it overheated again because the back of the Kindle WAS hot.  The third time, Mayday checked to see if I had the most recent update (I did) so I did the hard reboot and it worked fine.  I decided to do a hard reboot once a week and make sure that it doesn't overheat.  I did the reboot this morning, listened to music from my cloud and then put it down to do other stuff.

79369,It pains me to have to give this one star....,Amazon Customer,R1WTVB0EOQEBKY,"This is the most difficult one star review I've had to give. Usually a one star product is clearly junk, but that is not the case here.If I were to rate the hardware only (I bought the HDX 8.9 w/o special offers), I would say it's a five star product. But we can't just rate this on hardware alone, we have to look at both the software and Amazon's walled garden policies.I read all the reviews from the gadget sites about how this was somewhat crippled by lack of access to google play, but that you could sideload apps, and that if you wanted to consume Amazon content that it was a good choice. As all I wanted it for was to read ebooks, I thought it would be perfect. It has probably the best screen I've seen on a tablet (compared to my new Galaxy Note 2014 and my wife's Ipad Retina, the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 is the better screen). The problem was I have a lot of technical ebooks (I'm a software developer) from Oreilly press, and I prefer PDF format for these. I also have a few ePub books. I did some research and found moon+ reader pro in the Amazon store. I figured I was good to go, I could buy Moon Reader + pro and have a device that could read all my kindle books, watch amazon prime, and read my ePubs and PDFs. Then the tablet came and I logged in to the store, and Moon Reader + Pro was not listed. I followed a link from the web and lo-and-behold it says ""Not compatible with your device""..which was interesting because the free version worked just fine. I wanted the pro because It supports PDFs and the ads are annoying. I then looked for other readers in the Amazon store that would support ePub or PDF and work on my device and guess what...there weren't any. Interestingly enough, there are other readers in the Amazon store such as Aldiko..they just say they aren't compatible with the HDX 8.9.. if you sideload them from the web they work fine though so it's not a compatibility issue. It's Amazon putting artificial limits on what content you can easily view on a kindle device. I don't mind the lack of Google Play because I can understand Amazon not wanting to pay to license from Google or follow Google's policies. But when they have apps that work for what I want in their App store but they intentionally limit access to them to Kindle Devices because they allow ePub and PDF content I have a problem with that.In closing, I would say that if you want to consume Amazon content, an Apple Ipad is currently the best choice. You have full access to a huge selection of apps, and you get the ability to view Amazon Instant Video and you get Text To Speech in the kindle reader. I absolutely despise Apple products so it pains me to recommend them, but for Amazon content the Ipad is the best choice. Android is purposefully crippled by Amazon. They do not have an Instant Video app for Android (other than for the Kindle Fire) and they don't support Text To Speech for Android (again other than the Kindle Fire). As for me I returned the Kindle and bought a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition. I don't get prime videos, but I do get Netflix if I want and I've started looking elsewhere for books and movies.I originally started buying from Amazon because I liked the choice, I liked the customer service, and they made things easy. With this tablet, they have taken away the choice of content and nothing was easy. Customer service is the only thing left. I'll still shop at Amazon for almost everything else I buy, but my great opinion of them was tarnished by the whole experience and I probably won't buy another Kindle device. At least they made it very easy to return the Kindle Fire.",2/25/14,0

6925,Apple I Pad 2 Sold By ShopVius Order Filledby Amazon,Carol A. Mears,R2AWOFWR2UJ7EN,"Be careful!!  I received this ""new"" iPad yesterday...turned it on, but the screen was completely blank! Called Apple support and they kindly walked me through the restore porcess...which did not work unfortunately.  I now have an appointment at the Apple store today for them to see what the problem might be.  The really weird thing is the ipad had a user name on the setup screen that was displayed on my macbook. as if soneone else owned this ipad before.  I thought I was buying a brand new iPad, and I paid full price.  So it should not have been used before, right?  Is Amazon/ShopVius selling referbusided products on the cheap or just unknowlingly doing so through a second party??  Not a good business practice Amazon!  Buy from Apple directly if you desire their products.  Safer by far.Not a happy camper!!",2/1/14,0
94559,"Excellent screen, the wifi is not production ready and update Its a BRICK","S. Kolinjavadi ""skolin""",R10V9BS5V2VL94,"Excellent tablet, layout and very good price, but how come Samsung have gotten away with a tablet whose wifi connection becomes sub-par when you let it rest or go into power saving mode for a while, when it comes back, your home wifi is toothless, though the other devices are doing just fine. This is a major problem with this device and the cause of the two stars missing. Im surprised there has been no fix for this yet.---UPDATE-----This is the most disappointing thing of all, its now a BRICK that may require surgery before it can walk again. Evidently I'm not the only victim of what sums upto to very poor engineering and worse still evidence of continued indifference, many Samsung products including this one get into a vegetative state if you happen to let the battery completely run down before you put it back on charge. I had this misfortune last week when I did not have quick access to the charger and now the damn thing won't wake back up no matter how much I charge, its playing dead as a DODO and it happened one day after my return window ended. And the reports on this problem are legion. How can you sell a product, a decent one in other terms in the market with such a huge problem that practically makes it a brick!3 starts to 1.",2/15/14,0

It is lighter than KFHD, but I really, so far, don't see that it was a wise purchase on my part.  My two requests for help showed me that these poor folks have had minimal training and weren't able to help.  The software is very glitchy with apps and magazines/newspapers.  Perhaps because it is new, no one has a clue how to fix things, except if you're willing to get through to Kindle technical support, and they can help by calling you on the phone.

After recharging it, I used the Mayday button and they told me that it may have overheated and that I should do a hard reboot (hold the off button for twenty seconds).  It happened again but figured that it overheated again because the back of the Kindle WAS hot.  The third time, Mayday checked to see if I had the most recent update (I did) so I did the hard reboot and it worked fine.  I decided to do a hard reboot once a week and make sure that it doesn't overheat.  I did the reboot this morning, listened to music from my cloud and then put it down to do other stuff.

However, the display suffered more from the ""blue"" on the sides more than others I'd seen. Even the display model at my local Best Buy didn't have the huge variance this one did. So, I sent it back and got a replacement from Amazon.And then that replacement's display started flickering randomly. Complete wipe and reinstall didn't help, another hardware issue.So, I contacted Amazon for a THIRD device. Which they sent quickly....and that one had more screen issues.I don't know if I just had bad luck, but that's the point when I gave up. Three devices in a row tells me that either I had extraordinarily bad luck, or Amazon's QA on these devices just isn't up to snuff. I used the refund for mine to get a nice new Paperwhite which (so far) is flawless.If you want a tablet and really don't want to play roulette on whether you get a good one? I'd advise getting an iPad or a Nexus 7 instead. This one just irked me one too many times with the return-replace-defective cycle. Sorry, Amazon.

16390,not what expected,tito,R2NJVQ5NVYOHMV,First of all I bought this product thinking it was brand new but instead what I got was a blackberry playbook 64gb NOT in original box and without any of accessories that comes with such as the sleeve and usb and instead it came in a cheap white gift box that didnt securely hold the unit inside. As for the charger its not the right playbook charger it came with a small blackberry charger rated 800mah (original playbook charger rated 1800mah and with yellow usb tip)as for the unit itself it had me wonder if this is a refurbished unit and looks like new but it was clean with no scratches but surely was stored somewhere for a reallg long time since battery was completely drained and wasnt able to get anything out of it. After charging for 4 hours the battery got up from zero % to 2% and then it charged normally to 100 % in 1 hour 30 minutes just as it should (this is what happens when a unit is left for long period with battery completely drained) overall since this is my second playbook I was really disapointed with it but in fairness to the unit itself once I powered it up after solving the battery issue and updated to the latest version OS it ran as it should and had no signs of problems.,2/14/14,0

Like other tablets you can only download programs from there app store, but in those other stores any developer can add a program to the store. With Microsoft only apps that have been pre-approved  by Microsoft are available. There are many apps where you can only get some half baked version of like facebook or pinterest.

58786,ipad vs MS Surface,Aman,R3SMMYSRY22ZAE,"I have 2 iPads previously and so when time came to buy another, iPad was the top contender, but given the rising popularity of Microsoft Surface and Samsung Galaxy tab, I decided to try those out. MS Surface won hands down in my experience.First off, you can actually run more than one website on the Surface. If playing a Youtube video on the Surface and at the same time briefly browsing a different website, the Youtube video continues to play. Not so on the iPad. The video stops the momemt you browse to another website even in a different tab.Secondly, as far as Youtube is concerns the Surface version runs all videos like a full blown laptop. The iPad version runs only a subset of the videos and tells you to play the others on a computer.Thirdly, the Surface has a built in stand. No need to buy a cover stand separately.Fourth, even when not using the stand, the Surface is much easier to hold in the hand - slips much less than the iPad.I like the Surface user interface for switching from one browser tab to another better than the iPad. Not sure if that's a definite win for everyone since some folks may prefer the IPad.Not to mention the Surface is about half the price. True, iOS has more apps, but for all the apps I use (Amazon Instant Video, Netflix, Youtube, Skype, WhatsApp, email, browser, Yelp, and some travel related apps), both have all the apps needed. In fact the Surface has more Office apps for those who care about Powerpoint and Word.",2/23/14,0

I emailed Kurio twice without ever hearing back from them and of course, they have no phone number listed.  I tried to start 2 live chat sessions and no one ever joined and then I finally reached someone on live chat and was told to perform two different methods for a factory reset - neither of them worked.  I would never recommend this product to anyone, not only because the Kurio itself is a poorly made product but because it is difficult to reach anyone at their company and they do not respond to tech support emails.

9724,Expensive and useless paperweight,D. W. Lunt,R3FMEOAM5LS2T1,"Bought this unit at another retailer several years ago. Happy for quite  a while, then something happened to ability to connect to home wifi network. All other devices in house continue to work fine. That includes laptops, tablets, printers, DVD player, and Roku. Searched for support online. Found forums full of similar complaints. Lots of potential solutions but none has worked for me. Even purchased an extender for wireless router. As it is I have to sit on floor in front of the router or the extender to get more than a single bar and to access anything including Amazon. I used device to watch Amazon movies on Prime, will not be continuing Prime subscription since this POS won't connect well enough to view anything. Of course it does not have an Ethernet connection so I can't even wire the paperweight to the internet.No apparent solution from Apple in the works as they appear to not recognize the problem is an iPad problem.I believe Apple IOS updates have degraded the capability. Probably a corporate decision in order to sell new devices or sell devices with 3G/4G so continuing revenue stream come in from the ISP subscriptions.I can't believe the lemmings in the Apple market let this company get away with the stunts they pull.",2/11/14,0

I am so disappointed and frustrated with this purchase that I wanted to submit a review to save others the time, hassle and money. The first problem occurred when I attempted to read the user manual before doing anything with the tablet. It was horrific! The manual was written with english words but the grammatical errors, spelling errors and everything else about it was so poor that I couldn't make sense of it. It was like reading a different language with english words. Once I let it charge for the day I gave it a try, only to be completely disappointed! I realize I didn't purchase an iPad so I was willing to give it a chance. I tried to play a netflix from it only to find that I could hardly make out the image on the  screen. I also had to hold the tablet at one exact angle in order to even see anything. The sound was so poor I couldn't tell anything was even coming out of the speaker until I turned it over and held it right up to my ear. (That was after I had turned up all of the sound). The final complaint and what lead me to my decision to return it, (as if the above is not enough) is that there is such a delay when pressing an icon that I felt like I had to keep pushing it to make sure it was recognizing my touch. Actually, I can't say there is anything good about this tablet. Buyer beware, Do NOT but this! I don't even want to give it one star.

56896,Not worth the money,Joe Knaus,R1T602B36D8C7F,These tablets are useless. They don't charge very well. They don't turn on half the time. They can't be charged with the usb cable that came with. I have returned them.,3/16/14,0
118700,hard to get tablet to turn on,William J Pfannenstiel,R3B0LWOY8LCDAZ,"I couldn't get the tablet to start the first time I tried to turn it on, so I plugged in overnight and then tried again.  Still wouldn't turn on so I put it aside plugged into power.  Went back to it later and it was on.  It was working normally except it was always tricky to turn on.  Every time I wanted to use it I seemed  to have trouble getting it started. I contacted Tablet Express by email and they had developed a fix for the operating system.  I had to buy a micro SD card to download the file too, and then insert into the tablet and restart tablet.Well guess what. I couldn't get the tablet to start up.  So I got back in touch with the Tablet Express person and was given a different file. I could now start the tablet but it wouldn't update itself.  So I was told to ship the tablet back and they would fix it.  I wrapped it in bubble wrap and shipped it in. I received an email back saying the tablet screen was broken and that it wouldn't be warranty.  They asked me how it had gotten broke. Well during the time I was emailing back and forth I was sending them pictures of the screen that I was seeing. There was no breaks in the screen.  So I feel like I got nothing for my first foray into the tablet world.Thanks Tablet Express for nothing! You got my money and I got your junk.",3/23/14,0
114257,Task Manager (not responding),SBK479,RX54JPIGBFN8,"(Update 3/9/14: Wow, the Microsoft fanboys (or maybe employees) are really proving my point with the downvotes. You'd think if they just made a product that, you know, didn't crap out after three days, they wouldn't need a PR-downvote squadron. PS, can I maybe get part-time work as a professional downvoter? Maybe it would help pay for school.)I'm writing this review on the laptop I got in exchange for the Microsoft Surface Pro 2 that I bought three days ago. It decided that it didn't feel like working anymore, so the touch interface and keyboard just stopped responding in any time shorter than 45 seconds. I couldn't even kill the process through the task manager because that froze too; nor could I even reboot it. Instead I got a laptop made by a company that believes in making products that work. FYI - Best Buy made the exchange process very easy.I needed a Windows machine for a grad class, and I had heard good things about this one. Frankly, I'm insulted that something this blatantly broken and unfinished was released with a $1000 price point.You'd think after 30 years of stealing other people's ideas and putting out one substandard product after another, Microsoft would understand that consumers will only take buying crap for so long. It's not good business sense to continue to market this trash and just assume consumers will buy it because they have no other choice. Market dominance is not an excuse to treat customers like this, nor is it something that lasts forever.(PS - for those who would downvote this review because they love MS products, spend your money however you wish and may God bless you.

I am returning this device with a lesson learned - never buy electronics from 3rd country companies.  I am certainly not racist by saying that - but these companies produce an extremely poor product, and the people they hire work for hardly any money.  Spend the extra money on a name brand.

61808,"Junk! horrible warranty service, major reliability issues",Construction pro,R2OHBRFRZCJXR,"I have had this tablet for exactly one year and I regret ever buying it.  I have been very gentle with it and never damaged it.  However, I have had to send it to Texas 3, yes that's right, 3 times for warranty service.  Twice I had to pay shipping to get it there - about $30 worth.  The first time they had to replace a defective gyroscope- it suddenly stopped rotating the screen.  The second time it would continually try to reboot itself.  A complete reset would not fix the problem.  They sent it back saying nothing was found defective, but they obviously reloaded the software because it worked when it came back- for about 1 month.  Then it broke down the third time.  It just suddenly tried to reboot itself and wouldn't quit with the little swirling colored circles on the screen.  It would not even let me complete a factory reset and it stopped even turning itself on.  Each time it breaks down, you have to send the thing to Texas for service.  They keep it for over a week after they receive it, before they ship it back to you.  When they do ship it back, it is Fedex, and if you are not home all day to sign for it you have to go to Fedex to pick it up- a 1/2hour drive each way for me.  The total turn around time each repair is about 3 weeks from the time you ship it out until it arrives back at your local Fedex.  In one year I have lost all my data 3 times, have been without a tablet for 9 weeks total, and now I am awaiting it being shipped back to me the final time.  The thing is, my warranty expired during the time they were working on it, so next time it dies on me- that's it, I'm out my time, money, and data.  Really horrible way to treat an Asus customer!  I have an Asus desktop and 2 first gen Nexus 7's and a second gen Nexus 7.  I doubt I will buy another Asus product.  Beware!  By comparison, I had a Bosch circular saw that died after a year and a half of light use.  It was out of warranty, however Bosch fixed it free of charge and I got it back in exactly 1 week from the day I dropped it at UPS to go to Atlanta.

111669,Android 4.4 criticaly limits MicroSD use; Sluggish performance; Offers limited,Hodor,R3127BAILNYMGG,"I purchased a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition (black, 16GB) at Best Buy a few weeks ago. I only used it for a few days before deciding to return it. There's a lot of stupid problems here, not all of which are Samsung's fault. But overall, it's a no-deal for me.1) The Simpsons game ""Tapped Out"" ran so slow as to be unusable. The constant stuttering of the screen updates and the slowed-down animation made it obvious that somehow this particular game challenged the quad-core processor in the Note. It's a serious defect, considering a two year old model like the ASUS TF300 could run the game 10 times faster, and THAT unit is sluggish. This might be a specific issue with this game, and could be a software fix from EA. But it's important to consider, as the game it's very popular and widely used.2) The offers are  good deals, but they are limited to the device itself. For example, the free year of GoGo Inflight Internet? That's not something you can add to your existing account or even create a new account for. Instead, everytime you want to use it you must connect to GoGo from this tablet, click on a ""Chat Now"" button and request from a CSR a one-time code for that flight. You'll need to repeat that process everytime you want to use it, and it can't be used on a laptop or other device. Similar limitations exist for many, but not all of the offers. The 3 free audio books? Only 1 per month. All of these offers are really just trial subscriptions with a few exceptions. I *strongly* recommend checking out the details and fine-print here before buying: [...]3) This Note uses Android 4.4 aka ""KitKat"". There is a major change in Android 4.4 that affects how MicroSD card access works. Apps will no longer be able to access the entire card and read or write anywhere they want. Instead, each app will have its own little closed-off area to use, nothing else. This means general-purpose file explorer apps will not be able to see anything on a MicroSD card. Photo viewers will be similarly limited. Backup programs will not be able to backup files from a MicroSD card (though they will be able to backup file TO the MicroSD card). Most significantly, you will NOT be able to move apps to the MiroSD to free-up space in the internal memory. This is all being done by Google, not Samsung, but it still impacts this model.

This week I decided to get a replacement battery, and after installing it the tablet would boot up like normal but still wouldn't charge.

39406,Nabi will make your kid cry,Eileen Long,R3D0V1WCTU47CO,"I bought two of these for my grandchildren last year as I like the idea of something that would give them something they wanted with protection and educational aspects I wanted.  The product worked great at first though I was disappointed to see that most of the loaded apps were bloatware or just advertisements for me to spend more money on their education software.A big issue for some is unavoidable because Google won't allow devices access to Google Play if it modifies the operating system in any way.  Since the Nabi uses a modified version of Android software that limits access and that is a big part of the selling point for Nabi, Fuhu's only option was essentially Amazon's app store.  After finding out the education software that came with the device was worthless it would have been nice to be able to be able to bypass 'Mommy mode' if we could get to the Google Store.  As it was adding software was much more difficult than it needed to be and I expect only the most computer literate ever would figure it out.The device itself was nice and despite some of the complaints I've seen, you really had to go out of your way to damage it with the bumpers.  The screen is tougher than most others I've seen on the market and if a kids breaks a Nabi their drop would break a Ipad/Nexus/Kindle.  In fact I'd bet a Nabi would be the toughest of them all.All of the above is meaningless when considering the last issue.  After a month my biggest concern after getting software set up was trying to get them to do other things than play with their Nabi (as I've said earlier the educational software was a bait and switch).  Then we started having issues with one of the units screen as lines appeared and the only thing that would fix it was a reboot.  Anyone that has kids knows how bad it can be when one kid's device works and theirs doesn't so I spent countless hours with support trying to figure out the issue.  They released a software update but within another month the other device started doing the same thing.  The kids didn't mind rebooting but a few weeks later I released the devices weren't holding a charge as they'd charge them all night and they'd be dead 30 minutes later.  We had them use the cord when they used them but after a while even that wouldn't work.  Within 4 months both were very expensive bricks.The manufacturer has given some lip service that a new cord would fix the issue but it didn't work for us.  We tried to call customer support but gave up when 1) we never got a response and 2) saw thousands of others complaining about the same thing.  They ignored further contact for months well within the warranty period but after a while we (like most people I'd expect) gave up as it wasn't worth the frustration.Ultimately I think the combination of cheap parts, poor quality control, and modified software were too much for the great chip inside to offset (it uses the same processor you will find in many other devices like the Kindle and Nexus).  I do think someone at Fuhu knew these devices were faulty when they sold them and criminal charges should be filed but it will never happen.  I've written off the $400 we spent on these devices as money lost and my only regret is not getting a Kindle Fire or Nexus for the same price.And I will never buy anything from Fuhu ever again (though I doubt they will be around in another year with their rep).",3/23/14,0

I asked ""What good is the warranty if I can't return this product which appears to be defective?""They said I could return it if I wanted to pay the shipping but all they were going to do was the same thing I did - reset it.

65778,"Junk! horrible warranty service, major reliability issues",Construction pro,R2OHBRFRZCJXR,"I have had this tablet for exactly one year and I regret ever buying it.  I have been very gentle with it and never damaged it.  However, I have had to send it to Texas 3, yes that's right, 3 times for warranty service.  Twice I had to pay shipping to get it there - about $30 worth.  The first time they had to replace a defective gyroscope- it suddenly stopped rotating the screen.  The second time it would continually try to reboot itself.  A complete reset would not fix the problem.  They sent it back saying nothing was found defective, but they obviously reloaded the software because it worked when it came back- for about 1 month.  Then it broke down the third time.  It just suddenly tried to reboot itself and wouldn't quit with the little swirling colored circles on the screen.  It would not even let me complete a factory reset and it stopped even turning itself on.  Each time it breaks down, you have to send the thing to Texas for service.  They keep it for over a week after they receive it, before they ship it back to you.  When they do ship it back, it is Fedex, and if you are not home all day to sign for it you have to go to Fedex to pick it up- a 1/2hour drive each way for me.  The total turn around time each repair is about 3 weeks from the time you ship it out until it arrives back at your local Fedex.  In one year I have lost all my data 3 times, have been without a tablet for 9 weeks total, and now I am awaiting it being shipped back to me the final time.  The thing is, my warranty expired during the time they were working on it, so next time it dies on me- that's it, I'm out my time, money, and data.  Really horrible way to treat an Asus customer!  I have an Asus desktop and 2 first gen Nexus 7's and a second gen Nexus 7.  I doubt I will buy another Asus product.  Beware!  By comparison, I had a Bosch circular saw that died after a year and a half of light use.  It was out of warranty, however Bosch fixed it free of charge and I got it back in exactly 1 week from the day I dropped it at UPS to go to Atlanta.  Asus needs to take a lesson from Bosch on how to do customer service.  Asus, you have lost my loyalty.",3/4/14,0

My son's screen broke within 3 days. Granted, he probably threw it or something, but he's played with my Kindle Fire for over a year without damaging it in any way. Within another couple of weeks, the power button on the pink one got stuck and the tablet cannot be turned on at all. We thought maybe she had done something wrong because she is young. But like my son, she has played with my Kindle for some time without ever causing any damage. Within a month after that, the purple one did the same thing. This happening made it clear to me that the product is the problem. My oldest child is 8 and knows how to handle and take care of tablets. She has been playing with my Kindle since I bought it 2 or 3 years ago. So now I have three useless tablets that I paid almost $80 a piece for. I am also giving 1 star for customer service. We contacted Amazon about returning the tablets (pink and purple only because we aren't 100% sure that our son didn't do the damage). They authorized a return for one, but not the other claiming it was out of the 30 day return period. Well, duh. Of course it is. We bought these for Christmas presents and did not wait until the last minute to buy so 30 days pretty much passed before my kids laid hands on the things.

First of all, the seal was broken (opened), and Amazon has covered the broken seal with another seal of their own. I can clearly say that there were two seals one on top of the other. But they've put the other seal on top of the original broken seal so that it would appear that the product was new and unopened. The second thing is that there was an obvious fingerprint on the device when i opened it, And also some dust inside. The third thing is that the original stickers ( that cover the sides and the back and the screen ) were replaced by a cheap replica and i could tell the difference for they were not placed perfectly onto the product and there were bubbles appearing on the screen sticker.

My kids have had these tablets a week one of the chargers is broken (yes already) The tablet freezes if it works at all, the volume is bad I can't even explain to you... Nothing works! So I go to the manual which is a joke to call it that... as only one of the Zee-pads came with the ""manual"" which is written in broken English to the point it's hard to even comprehend what there trying to say. The tablet is a cheaply made Chinese product missing its correct accessories.. And so I contact the ""seller"" to finally get a reply after chasing butt for days. Oh they will take it back but I have to pay for shipping, I can't get a refund but an exchange after fees and only if they deem no damage was inflicted on the tablet...At this point I can't even cope with this, the tablets are horrible! My kids are in tears and I have no answers for them. I refuse to waste any more money on these things after the $153 to buy them.. I try and refund with Amazon but see here is the catch they were opened ( yes well hello how was I meant to know they where broken) and Amazon only fulfilled shipment so of course I'm stuck with the seller who has no number for me to call. USA wholesale you suck what kind of company doesn't even have a contact number? I can't tell you how bad I feel for my children.. Money does not grow on trees it's not like I can just replace these. I advice anybody considering a tablet for your kids to stay clear of these... iPad, kindle, Nook etc is the way to go...

The specs are great, and I was really thrilled at first, I could sideload apps and the community WAS even able to root, I even HAD live wallpapers.  However, Amazon updates without warning and there is no way to stop updates without losing internet connectivity.  Ultimately, an update broke my device, and even if I had managed to avoid the updates the tablet becomes nearly worthless without internet.  I'm very sorry that I bought from this company when there is another line of devices that would have worked much better for what I wanted and expected.  I wouldn't buy any other Amazon anything, they are worse than apple.  It's my device, I paid for it.  Amazon uses open source software that they get for no cost GNU, Linux, and Android and then they ruin it intentionally to lock in down and limit functionality.  Forcing people to buy from their appstore, stare at ads, and a dull black background.  Many of the apps available from amazon are old versions of apps that I already have paid for and use on my android phone and other devices.  I'm not going to pay again.  Amazon really stabbed us in the back on this one.  I've never had a device that didn't ask first before changing the software not even windows does that unless you op-in and you can always go turn off automatic updates.  Buying this tablet is the same as signing a contract with the devil, they managed to enslave free software and do whatever they want to your device without your approval.  It's not a version of unix like apple uses and pays for, it's Linux and Android and to subvert them like this is criminal.

28160,Hate it,Mike Bradley,R3OEKGHL9WEG0L,"I absolutely hate it. It's basic architecture is such that apps can't communicate productively with each other. As a result, every app has to duplicate computer-like sharing functions that would be trivial in a real computer. Most of the time, they do a miserable job of it. The screen is the best touch screen, so I've read, but that isn't saying much. You often have to keep whacking away at the screen to get it to respond and often the response is for the icon next to the one you're whacking. The whole touch screen user interface is remarkable, but it's very limited. It's simply impossible to make a screen icon or label for even the limited number of actions you can take; the actions for which there's no label/icon are basically secret. You may stumble over them, you may not. You certainly will never have the functionality of a real computer.In spite of all the problems of the iPad and its imitators, many people buy them. If you limit yourself to simple email handling, on the level of what we had 30+ years ago before the web, taking pictures, and browsing web sites while not using them to do much, I suppose the iPad is a decent enough choice.

77845,Excellent Tablet with Two Horrible Flaws,Anon,R4FRRW6ZJ7SN,"I purchased this Tablet because:  * I purchased an Xperia Z Ultra phone, was completely blown away, and decided ""I want a Sony Tablet instead of an IPad.""When I first got this Tablet, I was impressed -- it was thin, well built, and looked just like a bigger Xperia Z Ultra -- exactly what I wanted.Then, I raw into the following problems:  * the (thin) stylus that works on the Xperia Z Ultra does NOT work on the Xperia Z Tablet -- whatever magic was used to make pencils work as stylus on the Xperia Z Ultra was NOT applied to the Xperia Z Tablet. I'm not counting this against it as it's my fault for not researching this earlier.  * it's laggy -- I understand that this CPU is a QuadCore 1.5 GHZ -- and 1.5 GHZ is sorta slow by modern standards -- however, the UI is laggy + jitters -- I found it physically uncomfortable  * worst of all: with the Xperia Tablet plugged into a micro-usb charger -- I can LOSE CHARGE while using the tablet. Yes, let me repeat this again:  * I'm using the Tablet  * The tablet is plugged in via Microusb. The microusb is connected to a wall outlet (not my computer)  * I'm losing battery charge.  This last point makes me really unhappy -- as I intended to use the tablet as an input device for the PC. Well, it doesn't really work if my input device is LOSING CHARGE while connected to a microusb->wall.I consider these two flaws ""fatal"" in the sense that:  * if there's sufficient lag to make me uncomfortable, it's not really usable  * and if I'm losing charge when I connect it to the wall and use it, it limits my use casesBesides the above, I can find nothing wrong with the tablet.",4/27/14,0

64459,Should've Just Bought Some Books,Cory,R17QPMO6A5Z3GM,"I was replacing an original iPad and decided on a Kindle Fire. It failed in every way. The first one would not charge and was replaced. The second one takes about 36 hours to reach 90% charged and only about 12 hours to return to 0% even if I'm not using it much.But how does it perform?  Horribly. The built in Silk Browser for the internet freezes then crashes every 15 minutes or so. The apps available are meager. I added a few magazine subscriptions, but each time there's a new issue it has forgotten about my subscription and I have to go through the whole process again. Even when it knows I'm subscribed it always looks like they're about to charge me for the issue. YouTube videos are either the size of a business card or have the comments superimposed over half the video.The Kindle Lending Library available with Prime offers thousands of books to borrow, none of which you would ever want to borrow. I was upset when I found out I could only borrow one book per month, even if I finished it earlier. Then I realized that wasn't such a problem since I honestly couldn't find two books I wanted to borrow from the selection available.Reading a book on the Kindle is a decent experience. You can select any word and it gives you the definition. That is the nicest thing I can say about the whole device.I guess it balances out - the battery doesn't last, it crashes constantly, but it doesn't have any content I want to use, so it just sits on my coffee table. I don't know if it's charged. But it's a safe bet that it's not.",4/13/14,0

This means things like your banking app, your softphone, your cloud access apps, your local newspaper  and many other apps simply are not compatible with the device.

68149,Not What I Expected!,Traniqua,RWS082FMADFQM,"This tablet came to me in, not a box with the proper materials inside to keep it from becoming damaged, not even a heavy duty envelope, It came to me in this sticky wrap foam paper that was wrapped tightly around the nexus box, the stuff had a very thin layer of foam between the Adorama Camera company sheet of paper that was on top of the thin sticky foam. So as you can guess, the actual box the nexus came in was scratched up an dented in pretty deep. So all that aside, when i opened the nexus box the plastic that comes on the tablet looked like it had been used, it was also scratched an sticky. Smh, and sadly it goes on. When i took off the plastic, i proceeded to turn the tablet on. Turned the tablet on, an in the middle of the screen there was a vertical digital line! nothing was wrong with the background but, anything you do on the tablet had that digital vertical line down the middle. I initially sent an email to the seller an received no response back. So looked up their number an gave them a call. When i finally got someone on the phone, they told me that they do not repair or replace. They told me all they could do was refund my money to amazon an then amazon would refund it back to me, then politely added in that it would take a minimum of two months before i would receive my money.

84420,Not a secure device,Sclark,RM5PVQMEOK68P,"I ordered the Kindle Fire HDX, based on all of the favorable reviews.  My only complaint is that the device is not secure, right out of the box.  While the Kindle may be great at what it is intended to do, I pretty much rejected it due to a lack of security and regard to my Amazon account.  I am writing this review as a word of caution to others who may order it:When you order the Kindle, Amazon will ask you if you want to pre-register it.  They are doing this as there were many complaints of registrations failing after customers received the device, so they pre-register it for you before shipping, to cut down the amount of calls to their support.  The bad part of this is that, straight out of the box, you can click on ""Shop Amazon"" and go straight into your account.  The app, or the Kindle itself, does not ask for your credentials.  What this means is that my Kindle could have been mis-delivered, someone could have opened the box, powered on the Kindle, and had immediate access to my Amazon account (settings, Order History....everything).  I was even able to go shopping and could have made purchases, all without being prompted for my account credentials.Even with a passcode lock on the device, once registered and accessed, the Kindle prompts you no further for your Amazon credentials.  For some folks this might be OK, but for others who loan their Kindle to their kids, friends, or are just plain security conscious, this may be an issue for them.  It would be nice to see Amazon step up security and regard for customer's privacy on their portable devices.",4/30/14,0

15207,Spend the extra money for a better brand,DebLW,R2FKGBHB5P8B97,"I've had this tablet for a year and a half now, and I regret 'cheaping out' every time I pick the thing up.  The touch screen is sluggish, the response time is slow (and there's nothing wrong with my WiFi) and compared to the resolution of the screens on other tablets out there, it's average at best. One piece of advice - do not, whatever you do - let the battery go below 10% because if it does out entirely, you may never get it started again.  The charger adapter is finicky, and once in a while the tablet will just not start up.  At all. You'll have to find a thumbtack, flip the thing over, and stick it in the ""reset"" hole on the back of the machine. And even then, you may have to do it more than once. I bought this because I didn't want to spend twice the amount on a higher-end tablet... TRUST me when I say it's worth the extra money.

89692,Minuses outweigh the plusses,Michael J. Lipphardt,R32KOT5ABY3B34,"I have several items I use to read Kindle books and watch movies on.  One was the HDX 7.  I also us a second gen Nexus 7 and iPad Mini Retina.  Often I use a smartphone, like a Note 3 or Icon.  I will compare the HDX7 to these.First is screen.  I nailing this because this is the big problem.  This is supposed to be a book reader.  But that purple/violet glow intruding into the readable space is awful.  And it does not disappear regardless of your background settings - black, amber (my favorite) or white, it's always there.  Sadly it's MOST apparent in amber, which color is otherwise the easiest on your eyes.As a video display device, for movies and such it seems much better.  I suspect it's just not as noticeable with things going on on-screen.  It's there, but doesn't seem as bothersome.  But the screen is why I returned it.  Of the devices I mention, the best screen by a long way is the Nexus 7.  It's a nice reader.  Far better than the HDX.  The iPad came in last because while screen res is fine, you cannot get a decent sepia from it.  Sepia is nearly white.  Oddly. the iPad supports that cool page turn animation while the Android and WP and even the Kindle do not.As for watching movies, I think I have to give the nod to the iPad.  Sound is good on the iPad - nearly as good as the HDX.  Make no mistake, the HDX sounds great.  I hate to be repetitive, but that damn screen really sucks.  If you read the other reviews, it gets hammered for that constantly and Amazon pawns off some lame excuse about how their great display technology is so wonderful you should be happy to pay the price of that violet glow.  Well, the display is nice in the center.  But it's no better than the N7.  So, sound and display for movies goes to iPad, plus you can download your movies to the iPad just like the HDX.  You cannot, unfortunately, watch videos on Android.  Why Amazon doesn't allow this is stupid and beyond me.  You cannot BUY movies from iPad, but that is the only disadvantage there.As for use as a tablet - the HDX is very clearly focused on use as entertainment, centered on Amazon.  There is little there that is free, unlike Android or iPad.  What is available is available ONLY through Amazon.  You cannot use Google Play to fetch apps.As far as performance goes, no quibbles.  The HDX screams.  It's very fast and smooth.  But then so are the other tabs, with the N7 being slightly slower.So, the summary.  If you were able to buy titles using the iPad, I'd say forget the HDX.  Get an iPad.  It's a far better general purpose tab than the HDX, and every bit as good as the HDX for movies and reading.  If you could WATCH movies on the N7, I'd say get that.  It has the best reading display of the three, and not being locked in to Amazon is a huge benefit.  If all you care about is consuming Amazon content and that purple hell-glow is OK with you, then get the HDX.  It's the smallest of the devices, with a slightly larger screen than the N7 (not as big as the iPad though) with good sound.  If Amazon ever gets it's head out of the sand, stops trying to convince everyone that the screen is actually OK, really it is, and FIXES IT, I will buy it again just for reading and movies.  Everything about it is great.  Except of course it's main component, it's reason for being, which sucks.",4/11/14,0

25970,Hate it,Mike Bradley,R3OEKGHL9WEG0L,"I absolutely hate it. It's basic architecture is such that apps can't communicate productively with each other. As a result, every app has to duplicate computer-like sharing functions that would be trivial in a real computer. Most of the time, they do a miserable job of it. The screen is the best touch screen, so I've read, but that isn't saying much. You often have to keep whacking away at the screen to get it to respond and often the response is for the icon next to the one you're whacking. The whole touch screen user interface is remarkable, but it's very limited. It's simply impossible to make a screen icon or label for even the limited number of actions you can take; the actions for which there's no label/icon are basically secret. You may stumble over them, you may not. You certainly will never have the functionality of a real computer.In spite of all the problems of the iPad and its imitators, many people buy them. If you limit yourself to simple email handling, on the level of what we had 30+ years ago before the web, taking pictures, and browsing web sites while not using them to do much, I suppose the iPad is a decent enough choice.

It was a snap to set up and worked well. It was ridiculously easy for a person more interested in content than technology to become even more of an avid Amazon customer than she had been before. We recommended it to our friends and relatives, at least 3 of whom immediately bought it as well. In fact we had 2 at one time. I traded mine for an older iPad 1 with a slightly damaged but usable first generation iPad; In the time I had it, I liked it. Unlike the Kindle Fire, I can still charge it and gets used daily.Amazon did a great job integrating Google's Android OS into their customer universe. Although it's a pretty old version of the android OS at this point, it does its job. In this case, Amazon built on something that worked and, for their customers, made it better. Good job.IF ONLY Google had designed the stupid USB power connector that now serves as a hinge to let the USB cord swing like a pendulum beneath it. Maybe we would be posting the previously deserved 5 star review rather than this 1 star tear.I'll probably be considered an ingrate for having a product a long time and then have it stop at the end of its useful life. The small crack on the screen of my now VERY old iPad is the only thing wrong wit hit. It holds a charge for days and still works with the older 4.x apps that we have on it. When it stops being useful as it is, it will be retired to my bedside as an alarm clock.What really makes me mad is that the Amazon Kindle Fire that has no cracks and a battery that still holds a charge, in theory, will probably never be used again. The USB connector on this unit broke, just like the one this unit was sent to us as a replacement for.The Amazon rep had the nerve to say that the USB problem, one we have lived with for along time now, playing with the USB for an eternity until the little lightning bolt tells us that it is charging, was something they had really not heard of as a problem.Amazon, if you can make flying delivery drones or hire flying moneys as stand-ins until then, why can't you stand behind your defective product? This was clearly a work-in-progress that allowed you to better know the market and develop the latest HDX which, by all accounts is rated as good as if not better than an iPad.We bought weeks after the product announcement. From what we read in the press, Amazon would sell at a loss if needed just to continue to grow their dominance in the book, music, and video markets.By saying we read books on this device, Amazon should know that we are, like many other reader, literate enough to read the scores of posting on the web about the problems with their charging port. It is a PRODUCT DEFECT and not a an issue of owner negligence. Our car still has a gas cap after 11 years. If it falls off, we can order an easy to install replacement on Amazon for it .Look at YouTube: there are so many videos explaining how to replace the USB port that it's almost funny. The glitch is that you need to know how to micro-solder at least 4 contacts onto the circuit board that is secured with a few dozen screws in the bowels of the device. The screws, I can handle. But spending $10 to $15 on Amazon for a replacement micro USB socket then dedicating a weekend to getting it in place is not in the cards.One online repair firm charges $39.50 to do it. They claim replacement isn't the problem: in their experience many of their repairs came back to them not because of the quality of their connection but because there never was any mechanical stability in the first place and have to improvise to glue or solder on additional stiffeners to keep it from recurring.When I called Amazon, after telling me that this was a rare if not unheard of problem that is just part of having a consumer electronic product, they quickly offered to sell me a new more recent device for around $120.This isn't customer service. This is inventory management: the unit they offered to sell for that price was the previous generation product an not the current one generating rave reviews. Using people dumb enough to buy a first generation product as the dumping ground for left over previous year devices isn't a sign of respect for people who just want to continue to want to buy stuff from Amazon.I am really sorry, Amazon. I know this review will be discounted as just another crank selling sour grapes. I just had to say something after my recent call. I don't like to be told that what I read and experience is new and unique or gleaned from the yammerings of other malcontents.Grow up and deal with us as client and not as rubes. Tell your service people not to use their own experience to justify why our problem is unique (""I have the same model and I've never had a problem with it...""). At least give them a script to read that doesn't make people with legitimate issues feel that we're wrong about what we know.*** This review was NOT written on my Kindle Fire...

108066,This product is defective and a waste of money,Timothy A. Johnson,RC8CLLZGQM6F9,This product is defective and a waste of money.  I purchased two of these tablets; one for each of my kids for Christmas and the touch screen for both of them stopped responding after less than two months.  I sent one in to be repaired and the screen stopped working again a little over a month after the replacement was recieved.  Also know once the tablet is out of the Amazon return period you have to pay return shipping to ASUS if you send it back under the manufacturers warrenty.

70701,Battery problem ultimately did this one in,"Alex Man ""gadget guy""",R22W2BRTT94TGQ,"This could have been a great tablet/phone. It was the ultimate all-in-one tool. Other reviewers have already reviewed the great points about it so I won't rehash them because I loved all the features, especially the stylus. My problem with it started two months into owning it. I might had ended up with a lemon but I still feel I should report it. After two months, out of nowhere, the battery started draining unreasonably fast. I'm talking, 1% every 30 seconds when it wasn't in airplane mode. The battery lasted longer when it was in airplane mode but not much. I wouldn't be able to sit through an hour and a half movie. For one more month I did everything I could think of to isolate the problem including reformatting it a dozen times, using various size SD cards, using different cases in case it had to do with overheating... and yes, it did run hot when the battery drained... but none of the above worked. It was to the point where 30% drainage would occur suddenly sometimes and before I knew it, I was under 10%. It was unreasonable and so frustrating, I had no choice but to return it.Kudos to Amazon for having a great return policy. I give them 5 starts for being understanding.",4/27/14,0

83453,Horrible.. DO NOT BUY!!!!!,Cindi,RG8IUQIMOJMYW,"If you have constant internet access and don't have to worry about paying for usage, then this wouldn't be terrible.I had the older version for years and was happy with it. I use my cell phone for wireless internet because I don't have other options where I live so I have to worry about data usage. I bought the 64GB because I wanted space to download movies and apps because my 3yr old can't stream movies do to our data usage issues. Even though I PURCHASED these movies and DOWNLOADED them to my kindle, my three year old can't watch them now unless I take the kindle to a place that has a stronger internet connection than my cell phone and go into each of the 50 or so movies to 'reset' them because the kindle will start giving her an error message that she needs an internet connection to watch the movies (even though they are downloaded on the kindle!!). Also... even when connected to the internet, I often go into my purchased movies and don't get the option to play the movies. I have to go in and out of the movies a couple times to get the 'play' button to show up. I have also found this unit to be slow and unresponsive.I initially purchased this Kindle in Jan 2014. In less than a week I was calling support because it kept crashing. I had to reset to factory conditions and redownload everything twice in the first two weeks. After two weeks of fighting with the initial purchase Amazon support suggested replacing the unit for me. When they did, they sent me a refurbished one (I had purchased a new one). They refused to send me a new one as replacement so I am now stuck with a piece of crap somebody else already sent back.One of the features I liked most about the old Kindle was Kindle Free Time... this is now crap. You have to have an internet connection to even use it. Kindle Free Time is advertised as a safe way for kids to use the Kindle without worries about them accidentally going on the web or purchasing things. But you now need an internet connection to even use it. So my 3yr old has to use they kindle without free time. She is constantly getting error messages and accidentally buying stuff because she hits wrong buttons. I have to watch my bank account very carefully and call Amazon to reverse everything she buys. This kindle is a constant headache. If she didn't love the games and movies so much, and if I had the money to re-buy all the movies/apps for some other tablet I would in a heartbeat. Unfortunately I am stuck with this piece of junk. I hope this review saves somebody else the headaches.",5/15/14,0
123601,Read this Before you Buy!!,"Susan ""Sue""",R27LIM76RVHADT,"If you are used to a laptop with a soft keyboard and a smooth touchpad as I have been, you will never get used to this touch screen type device. First of all the screen looks tiny as compared to my 15.6"" widescreen laptop, as a result it is # 1: hard to get used to typing on a virtual keyboard on the tablet. Many times, I had to tap the link multiple times for it to react. There is a major problem w chrome browser, the tabs:say 4 of them are open on the tablet in chrome. You cannot close them by tapping on the top of the tab (x) as you would do with a mouse and a laptop. The wireless is not too good on the tablet although it is fast with my laptop.Firefox browser is very slow on the tablet to open gmail. Overall there are major problems with this unit and I do not recommend purchasing this item, especially if you are used to a laptop w a touchpad/built-in mouse.

I thought  that maybe the bugs had been worked out. Wrong after only a week it would not charge. Just to note, it was never dropped. Water was never spilled on it. It was being charged with the original cord and plug that it came with. Just in case your possibly thinking  that I have electrical problems. I""ve lived in 3 different places. The most recent brand new construction. The last Kindle was returned for a refund and an ipad mini purchased instead. I have owned 3 ipads in the last few years and have never had a problem.

114411,Great until it stopped working!,JamRock,RQ03LKV07GBRE,"I purchased this in store on April 7 2014, few weeks go by and I am loving this device. Than on April 26 I plug it in to charge and go to use it a few hours later and the screen will not turn on. The device still works as I can hear it unlock using facial recognition. I can also guess where the numbers are and unlock the device that way too. I can make it ring using find my android. I can also plug it in to a PC and browse the files. Just what appears to be a randomly broken screen. No damage to the device at all and it has never been dropped. I babied the device.After calling best buy and learning their return and exchange policy is ONLY 15 days and that they would not take it back, I called google. Google was no help and told me to call Asus. Asus gave me an RMA number and I have to return it at my own expense for warranty repair. Btw, they say they may send you a re-manufactured or re-certified device in its place.....I have a screen protector on the device which will ruin the protector if I remove it, so I guess that is also more money down the drain. To make it worse I will have to pay for data while my device is away getting repaired or replaced.If you google nexus 7 screen problems or nexus 7 power problems. It's scary the amount of people with similar problems. There are all sorts of different power on/off sequences with power on and volume buttons to try and fix but none of them actually do.Will report back with what my experience with Asus is like. Very disappointed in best buy. If they can't guarantee a product for at least 30 days then they do not deserve my future business. Lots of other retailers both on and offline which still do 30 day.update: May 7 2014,Asus has had the device for 1 full week now, they have not been able to provide me a status online or through their support team.

121417,Stopped charging after 1.5 months! I WOULD BUY A DIFFERENT TABLET,Darrell B,R11U4K2SY1S44,"FIrst, I have yet to contact HP or Amazon about any problems, so this review will be revised as my problems are fixed.That said, my tablet worked perfectly up until last night. I haven't used it for much other than reading and watching a few shows. The battery had been working fine and holding a nice, long charge. Until last night that is... I had my charging cord plugged into a surge protector in my room, and that's the only place I had ever recharged the tablet. I watched one show and the battery was down to about 12%, so I decided to get the charger, as well as an extension cord, since the supplied recharging cord is a mere 3ft long. Well, I plugged it all in and nothing happened. I plugged it in multiple outlets, including the surge protector I'd always used, and still, nothing. Restarted it and tried again, shut it down twice and tried again, no charging. So, I'm done trying myself.When I first received the tablet, I thought how flimsy and short the recharging cord was, was disheartening. Seriously, all electronics companies seem to be cutting costs by shortening the power cords. I guess they want us running new outlets or running extension cords all over our houses. Then, the stupid tablet doesn't even tell you it's charging. Sure, it has a little white LED that goes on and off when you turn on or off the tablet and even blinks for a split second when you connect the charger, but it doesn't stay on continuously to let you know how the charging is going or to let you know its fully powered. Seems like engineering 101 was skipped here.Anyway, I'm not sure how I'll resolve this issue. I'll check with HP and Amazon and see what they can do. I may try to get a refund and find a device that seems sturdier. It's not like they can reconfigure my hardware and give me a sturdier power port and charging cable. This review will update as soon as my issues are resolved.Update: HP sent me a replacement charger after doing zero actual diagnostics and telling me that there was no problem with the tablet but there was a problem with the charger. HP customer service was friendly and helpful, slightly hard to understand, but the phone call took 40 mins just to get a new charger. It took about a week to receive my new charger after it sat at a the local Fedex distribution center for three days. That was annoying. When I finally received the charger and tried it out, it worked!...For about two weeks!!! I planned on just exchanging this product from Amazon but I'm passed the 30 day window so I guess Ill go through HP again and see if they can do something better this time. I WOULD NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IF I WERE YOU. Maybe I got a lemon, but two chargers in two months? Thats ridiculous.",5/17/14,0
96093,Don't waste your money on Kindle Fire!,Kindle Customer,R1UZ86VHU5XRI,"Yes, the screen resolution is very good...but that is the only redeeming quality this device has going for it! Consistently turns off and restarts while gaming or reading. It is very frustrating! Just download the Kindle app onto whatever quality tablet or phone you own or purchase and you will be much happier. The limit that Amazon has placed on acquiring apps is also a good reason to purchase an actual tablet and put the reader onto it. There also is no sd slot so every time you want to add movies or music you have to connect to a computer. I have purchased cheap 7 inch Android tablets which have been very dependable and worth the $75  that I spent.

However at the writing of this review, the TP8 has been out for nearly 5 months, and Lenovo cant even deliver them.Now that the Encore is $205 with prime shipping, it makes the TP8 even more pointless.Starting with the so called benefits:1920X1200 res screen:  At first glance, this seems like a really positive benefit of getting the TP8 over any other 8"" Windows 8.1 device, however after using Windows 8.1 on such a tiny display with that resolution, it quickly becomes a disadvantage.  Its hard enough using standard legacy windows apps at 1280x800, the same apps at 1920x1200 on such a small screen, become unusable with a finger.USB 3.0:  Sure, USB 3.0 is much faster than USB 2.0, who wouldn't buy this machine to gain that extra speed?

63806,Loved it at first... but it died 3 months after the One Year Warranty,ShellyP,R2IFMN9AL2F72F,"I loved my Kindle.  But I am very disappointed that 3 months after my warranty was up - my Kindle froze on the Kindle Fire screen with no apparent reason (I am very careful with this as a I use it every day).  When calling Customer Service, after trying to re-set it 900 times to no avail I was told that basically I can have a ""discounted"" price on a refurbished Kindle Replacement... and a $30.00 off certificate.  For me, that answer was not good enough and it never will be.As a pretty loyal customer to AMAZON I am extremely disappointed and am considering cancelling PRIME and finding other avenues for online ordering that have nothing to do with AMAZON.  This includes Zappos I believe.  Anyway, unfortunately there are few things I still need so I will be placing a couple more orders - but I'm not sure about after that.Also, why would I want the same KINDLE back when it only lasted a year and a half.  I think now I should have just taken my $300 and put it towards the iPAD.  Although more expensive, I know it would last and there would be more technical help available.  However it probably wouldn't be needed as I most likely wouldn't have this issue with it.I am appalled that I have read numerous complaints about the same issue with the Kindle, but yet AMAZON doesn't seem to think it's a problem with their Software.Pay the extra money for a table that will last.",5/14/14,0

Yes, I bought it, and yes, it arrived on time, but after that the experience has pretty much been downhill. My 8-year-old, super-responsible son (who saved his money for a year to buy a tablet) bought this - and within 2 days the glass was scratched up just from sliding your fingers around (which is supposed to be what you do with a touch screen). The charger port doesn't fit very well - so he asks me to plug it in so it doesn't get bent and rendered unuseable. If you want a cheap throw-away for a 3 year-old that will break anything you put in front of them anyway, then go ahead and buy several - you'll need to, these won't last even if used with care...",5/19/14,0

122678,"Stylus integrtaion good.  Poor execution, poor customer service",KLK,R2B3HQVFCTNG7E,"Nice idea in theory.  The stylus helps navigate the Desktop Windows OS.Not long after I purchased it, the front camera, ambient light sensor, microphone, and headphone all went out.  I spent hours trying to figure out why until it seemed to be obviously a hardware issue.  Went back and forth with ASUS phone and online support, was first told to reset the device (which they seem always to suggest as the first step)-which I'd already done.  Then an RMA (ship back for repair) was suggested; I had to take it to UPS and ship it across the country at my own expense.  For days, until I wrote to ask them where it was, there was no online acknowledgment that the device had been received.Eventually, it was sent back to me with the hardware issues fixed but Windows reinstalled.  I had to call Microsoft to activate Office, having previously had to reset the device so many times.  Then I discovered that Windows was not activated, so I got back in touch with tech support, and was told to reset the device yet again.  Can't understand why this wasn't done during the RMA.If you're used to high-resolution phones/tablets, the 1280x800 relatively dim screen is also a striking downgrade. Many stylus taps are also not recognized, and you also have to push hard enough with the stylus at times that you worry you're damaging the screen.Wish I had not purchased this or that I'd returned it via Amazon.  This has been a waste of my time and money.",5/6/14,0

63807,What a disappointment! Kindle Fire HD 8.9,C. Fletcher,R18ZNRUEXRS2VT,"I cannot for the life of me understand the positive reviews on this clunker. I got it for my birthday last year and noticed soon thereafter that it had a tendency to freeze. ""Silk browser is not responding, would you like to close?"" So I would close and restart and it would happen all over again. After putting up with this sorry state of affairs for several months, I wrote about my frustrations using the feedback feature. Customer service was prompt and worked with me for about two weeks resetting and registering etc etc, before offering to replace the device.

Consistently turns off and restarts while gaming or reading. It is very frustrating! Just download the Kindle app onto whatever quality tablet or phone you own or purchase and you will be much happier. The limit that Amazon has placed on acquiring apps is also a good reason to purchase an actual tablet and put the reader onto it. There also is no sd slot so every time you want to add movies or music you have to connect to a computer. I have purchased cheap 7 inch Android tablets which have been very dependable and worth the $75  that I spent. I am very disappointed in this device and wish I had gone with my gut and bought a galaxy or something.

88046,Great,H. M. Hicks,R3H0QJ99KUS2M1,I bought this Kindle to replace my Kindle Fire.  I loved the Fire but this new Kindle has some interesting new features.  I like the option of having the Kindle read to me.  I can also choose different voices .  However I wish  Explore by touch could be separated from the screen reader.  The display is much clearer than my old Kindle and steaming is much more stable.  Text seems to  me sharper and clearer.  It is well worth the price of upgrading.,1/3/14,1

I can carry it in my purse and it does everything that I want it to. It's fast and works great. I listen to books and music on it. Just love it. Got it for the lower cost and because Samsung has the ability to add up to 64 gb of memory to the tablet.,1/18/14,1
76583,Love it!,JohnFTL,R1S7615Y6O68OW,"I ended up buying this from a different vendor because Amazon was taking too long to ship it to me. So, I returned theirs when it finally came. Besides, I got it at a lower price from the other vendor. This thing is overkill for what I'll be using it for, at least for now, but I love the look, feel, and functionality of it. The 8 inch screen is the perfect size for me.  I have a 10-inch Samsung tablet that works great but I no longer use it because its too big to hold for long or to carry around. The Galaxy Note 8.0 is not perfect, and the price should be a bit lower for the features it has, but I haven't experienced any of the issues that some people are complaining about and I don't regret buying it.

The ""Silk"" browser is aptly named as it is rather silky web browsing much improved from my first generation Fire.  The screen is really brilliant and the colors are very rich even when it is in low bright mode; I use the auto brightness most of the time.  The sound quality is good and the size of the tablet is nice as well.  It's built to be dedicated to Amazon services but I uses those services so it fits me fine.

It loads much faster, is more clear and has more GBs than the older model.  I can now take pics and store/edit/save them - I didn't realize how much of a difference that makes to me (even if I can only take the pics from the front of the Kindle with this model).  It was super easy to transfer the books that I had purchased from one device to the other. . . I was happily surprised.I do not like the one and only cover option for this newer tablet.  I have knocked it off a few times, as it is only 'held' on by magnets (it IS nice that it folds into a stand, though).

This thing is many times faster than any of my pc's and it is pretty easy to get to learn how apps work on a tablet. My wife and I bought another one (heck we both have to have our own) after using the first one and enjoying it so much. I especially like that it comes with speech to text capabilities right out of  the box. The apps that are available make this thing an amazing piece of electronic equipment. Like I said, I'm no pc wizard but I can't find one thing I dislike about this product. Also I only had to use the MAYDAY button a couple times and it worked just as advertised.

72882,Good decision to buy!,irishjdf,R8W7308FCEBQJ,"Updated June 11, 2014 - I am updating this review because i don't feel it is honest. Shortly after i posted this review and having been able to play with the device for a while, I returned it for a refund. I didn't understand why i couldn't find a Youtube app or Google Earth. I quickly realized that although this was an ""android"" tablet it was controlled. I looked at the IPad Mini Retina and considered buying it. But there is one factor to why i wanted a small tablet. I have a full size IPad Air which is use for every day stuff. When i want to sit back and relax or watch videos b/f i fall asleep i want a smaller tablet. I have severe heart failure that was caused by a virus. My circulation is a big factor and holding anything up for a long time results in losing feeling in my arm. An iPad Mini was out of the question.  I purchased a Nexus 7 2013 and it was amazing. It was fast and light and I could watch Youtube and use the google apps, but there is no app for access to my Amazon Prime. I was in Best Buy and walked past the Kindle Fire display and stopped for a moment. What i quickly realized was that the HDX screen and colors are more vivid than the Nexus 7. It also responded quicker. An employee that was working there asked if i needed help and I explained that this was the tablet i really wanted but there is not Youtube. You can download a ""fix"" and install Youtube but it does NOT allow you to log into the Google environment. He told me about the Youtube Video app that he said was actually better than Youtube and allowed you to log in to Google to load your subscriptions, favorites, etc. There is also an Instagram alternative app. I decided to buy it and i can tell side by side the difference in speed and color between the Kindle Fire HDX and the Google Nexus 7 2013..the Kindle Fire HDX blows it away. I have adapted to the apps that it doesn't have because i have an iPad for backup. But so far its perfect. The sound difference when listening to music is much better than the Nexus also.The perfect choice for a 7"" tablet. Remember most Android tablets don't have access to the Amazon Instant Store. Its fast, has very sharp vivid screen and images, and has all the apps you need. Youtube can indeed be run through the browser.",1/4/14,1
90063,Bought as a gift for my wife - she won't put it down,J. Scholz,R1VIHP21ZVPOMO,"My wife is not a technical person. She wants things that ""just work"" so after debating between a Nexus 7 versus this, I ended up going with the Kindle.The special offers are unobtrusive and easily ignored. The screen is amazing - better than the iPad by far and pretty comparable to the Nexus 7 I use. She uses it for reading, Facebook, Pinterest, and a few other apps. Though I would prefer that Amazon just use the Google Play store she gets along well enough with Amazon's app store, despite the fact that common apps such as Google Chrome are missing.The Kindle also has some annoying limitations on customization. My wife wanted to change the background to a picture but apparently that feature is not implemented for some odd reason. She also wanted to rename it from Kindle #2 but apparently that is not allowed either. I think the tradeoff in being easy to use might have overstepped a bit here, as asking to put your own pictures on as a background shouldn't really be an issue, nor should renaming it to be more personally named be such an issue either. Perhaps a future upgrade will address these easy-to-fix usability issues.As to whether or not I would get her this again I would go with ""definitely"". Despite the missing features and apps this is a solid tablet that I feel will stand up to her use for many years.",1/1/14,1

I did get a screen cover and a stylus as things can get pretty small and a stylus works much better than your finger to tap the correct thing.  I am very happy with the resolution and the sound.  My only wish is that I would have liked an instruction booklet as this is my first kindle as well as my first tablet.  I keep finding things that  I didn't know were there.,1/21/14,1

75827,Superb,"H. S. Miller ""insatiable reader""",R5RF0EHMAKRZ8,"I have gotten every 7"" Fire as it came out.  All have been a pleasurable experience, but this HDX has exceeded all my expectations by far!  I was reluctant to get it as I only expected a software update and a few added gizmos.  I had hoped they would include another camera on it too, but no.What pushed me over the edge in purchasing it was a $50 coupon sent to me as a Prime customer, plus the knowledge I could sell my older HD Fire and recoup even more of the purchase price so it seemed to be worth a major software upgrade, all by itself.WOW!  Holy computational power, Batman!!!  I am more than delighted with this 7"" HDX!  The total difference between the older Fire HD generation one and this Fire HDX is amazing!  Incredible value here!  My only regret is that it doesn't support Flash, but neither did the HD unless you sideloaded Dolphin, and for the most part I can do without having Flash on it.  I do hope a software upgrade will enable Flash videos on it, and soon, but with the outstanding performance and speed of the HDX as it is, I can live without having Flash.  Besides, what a lot of people don't realize is, if you use any other OS (in order to view Flash) rather than the Amazon version, you lose all the great benefits of Amazon's cloud loading and storage, which is part of the reason for it's speed and super flexibility.This HDX is a true world-beater.  I can't imagine what even newer models could provide in addition except another camera on the 7"" model.  I have not used the Mayday help feature, but since I've used Fires from the very beginning I'm used to handling the OS.  I can see where the Mayday help feature could be absolutely invaluable to a beginning purchaser, though.  You get help on the spot and instantly.",1/27/14,1

73456,What a great product,D. Lemieux,R1HPGDZG5WZ4QE,"This is my third Kindle and they just keep getting better and better.The screen and resolution is so vivid and has a very fast processor, but I still wish they would make one that you could plug in either an SD or Mini SD flash card in it. But I give this Kindle a BIG 5 star. I also love doing business with Amazon, they are the best on-line company to do business with. Keep up the GREAT work AMAZON!",1/25/14,1
98940,A great gadget.,Jean A Swinehart,RO7EM41AL7CYD,"I was so ready to purchase the Kindle Fire HDX but I waited till the reviews were better.  And I am glad I did.  It works great.  No strange halo on the edges, it charges to 100%.  Holds a charge great.  Streaming off of Amazon Prime is very smooth.  Smoother than off my laptop.  Surfing the net is very quick.  There is so much I can do with it and I haven't even figured it all out yet.  The only thing that needs to be different is the speaker setup needs to be on the front of the Fire instead of on the back.  Camera works great.  Will post more once I have learned more about my new gadget.",1/8/14,1
86563,All I can say is wow!,"Carolyn A. Layne ""knitting addict""",RAZFX2MJ0KWC9,"I previously owned an Android tablet which was a dismal product.  So far I love the Kindle fire HDX 7"".  I had to use the Mayday button once when I was first setting it up and was thrilled at how helpful and easy it makes using the HDX.  I guess I am old fashioned in that I prefer to speak to a human being!  And you can actually see who you are talking to.  It makes it a great personal touch.  Thanks Amazon for coming up with this concept.  I am looking forward to using this tablet extensively.  I highly recommend it.",1/15/14,1
116211,Easy to use!,Teresa,RWPH3WR5X641P,"I am not a very tech savvy person, but this ipad air came highly recommended by a person that is. I asked this person what they thought about other tablets, such as Surface, or Android, which were a little less expensive, but he said this would be the easiest for me to ""figure out""---and it has been. I mostly use it to google things, any where from educational to gossip tv shows and can find everything easily. Not only does it have ""Siri"", you dont even have to type to enter a post on facebook. You just use the microphone thats easily seen, and speak what ever you would normally type. I no im only at the tip of the iceberg with what it can do, but i learn new things everytime i pick it up. Not being able to sit at a computer for very long, Im able to take the ipad to bed with me & look up things easily while resting in bed. I no several people that have them and they all LOVE them---i now see why.",1/21/14,1

98898,Loving it!,OKchic,R2EKC925UXE0ZA,"I am really enjoying my new Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.  I have had a original Fire, and 2012 Fire HD 7"". I wasn't really sure I could justify the upgrade this time, but I had wanted a little larger screen for a long time and really wanted one. I am glad I did. I had a little problem with the first one I received, but called and Amazon got me a replacement on the way immediately. I was able to use the first one until the replacement arrived and then sent back. This one is great. I love the great display, and I really love how light it is! I got a semi hard plastic shell type back for mine so it added almost no weight, after trying some other cases. I just slide that into a sleeve to put in my purse. It is so light weight for the size and is really comfortable to hold for long periods. I am a huge reader and listener of my Amazon Ebooks, so I love how seamlessly it works and syncs with my Kindle Paperwhite and other Fire HD. I actually had tried a Samsung Note for a few days, thinking I would try something different, but I am too much of an Amazon gal, and my books not being available to listen to easily for my commutes just was not working for me. The new Fire HDX is noticeably faster than the HD. I also love that it is much faster and with no interruptions when viewing Prime videos. I have had almost no problems with that. It sounds great and the videos are crisp and clear. I got a Bluetooth speaker I use some when I am up doing stuff around the house, so I can listen to my books or music. It is quickly becoming my constant companion. I was concerned about the lack of the Google play store just like many others. That is the main reason I tried the Samsung first. I do believe however, that the Amazon app store is improving all the time and for what I do, I have adequate apps. I do have a Samsung phone, so I do have access on it for anything I would run across that I couldn't get on my Fire. I think most people will be pleased. Give it a try! I am really glad I went ahead and got one. I haven't used my laptop in ages!",1/17/14,1
86554,Awesome!,Kindle Customer,R18P5CC7RT6KDS,Great graphics. Sooo much faster than my Ipad.  Couldn't be happier with the purchase. Even thinking about getting a second one.,1/17/14,1
90065,Better than expected,Chris,R1Y3WUA5CW4V9P,"I love the new Kindle Fire HDX. I was really unsure about upgrading from the original Kindle Fire. My 1st gen was working well, but I read about the browser speed improvement and I wanted HD.  I am a Kindle Prime member, but I have to admit I have not been taking advantage of Instant Videos as I should. I use my Kindle for reading, checking out a few blogs, and playing very few games. I now spend more time with this Kindle because using it is so easy...no glitches.  One of the things I appreciate with the upgrade is the improved keyboard. You can easily find a comma. Some friends encouraged me to download some interactive games like Iconmania, Heads Up Charades, and True or False, which we have all played together. I watched a movie with very smooth streaming. Don't hesitate to buy the new Kindle Fire HDX!I bought a Poetic cover for the HDX and it's great.The speakers, volume button and power switch are all accessible and the magnetic cover puts the Kindle to sleep.",1/1/14,1

It makes them angry that they paid more than I did.The Kindle Fire HDX is easy to use, has all the features that anyone needs. Lots of Apps are available  and are easy to install.This is the best tablet available in my opinion. The graphics are amazing. I plan to order another one in the future for my best friend and future wife. Thank you Kindle!",1/24/14,1

They came on line quickly, were very polite and knew exactly what to do about my problem. I only wish I could remember the young lady's name that was so helpful. I was back up and running within 5 minutes. Excellent job people. I have the technical abilities of a toad and she patiently stayed with  me until I got. By the way I own 3 of the Fire, 2 of the HDX's. Thanks for the help.",1/28/14,1
59552,It is an iPad,Springer Spaniel Dad,R3KA4RYDSPH6SN,"Like the headline says, this is an iPad, similar to the 3 generations before it. Nothing new to see here. Why do I keep buying this crap? There was nothing wrong with my old iPad and yet I felt the need to have a newer iPad. Now I have my new iPad and I can't tell it apart from my old iPad. Does anyone else have the same thoughts and feelings I have about these damn iPads?",1/10/14,1
84954,So good!,Amazon Customer,R10SE3HVKDY27P,"I've had a second gen Kindle for years that I didn't want to part with, but now I've found a new love. I love the color, ease of use, portability, FreeTime, May day, everything is just awesome. I wish it had a rear-facing camera but I can live without that. I purchased a Bluetooth keyboard case to go with it and it's this fantastic little pseudo laptop I can carry in my purse!

85740,My views on the Kindle 7 HDX.,Jim Kuhn,R3878DQNW7OPRW,"I own other tablets, but find my Kindle quickly becoming my go-to choice. With its ability to cover multiple email providers it makes itself the practical choice when you can only choose one tablet to carry. The visual clarity of its screen is unsurpassed. Its sound is robust and clear. The Kindle's physical dimensions are outstanding. It is remarkably thin and light. I can hold it for long periods of time in complete comfort. The Kindle has become the tablet I give as a gift. I give the Kindle my unreserved endorsement.",1/2/14,1
79314,Can't live without my Kindle.,Leslie Becker,RDYKWLA6OY3H4,"This is my 3rd Kindle and I absolutely love it. I had a Fire HD 8.9 and was very happy with it but I was excited about the changes they made with the HDX so I just had to have one. The graphics are amazing and I am very happy with the placement of the power and volume buttons. Also, because of the slimmer profile and the lighter weight it is much nicer to hold. I'm already looking forward to the next model upgrade. Thank you Amazon!",1/29/14,1

116584,Great Item,Amazon Customer,RSTC84C96OOAA,"I bought this for my wife. She had the original ipad and used it constantly. It was so heavy to lug around so I decided to upgrade her to the new iPad air. She absolutely loves it, the new retina display is beautiful and it weighs a full pound less. I would highly recommend this device to any one.",1/23/14,1
31018,"I love this tablet, but there's always cons.","Amazon Customer ""D.S.""",R75LRFO04TB4T,"I truly love this tablet, I really do. I have a Galaxy S3, so I immediately decided a Samsung tablet would be what I purchased. I would not, however, pay $400 for it (I bought it on a lightning deal for around $340) for a few reasons.No home button - I didn't think this would bother me. Turns out, it does, and I'm glad it's something they included with the 2014 edition. If the screen goes dead, you have to press the power button, and since I have a lock on my tablet, I have to go through that again. If an app freezes (which happens occasionally, but not often) you have to use the power button instead of having a button to return you to the home screen. This is my biggest issue with this tablet.S-Pen is lacking a feature I would have liked, which would be to turn off sensing my fingers/hands/skin. I bought this tablet for note taking and drawing, but it's almost a chore because the screen constantly skips around when I try to use the S-Pen with it because my hand or wrist rests on the tablet as well. It's annoying. I know some app's allow you to turn off the sensitivity, but I shouldn't have to pay $4.99 for something to do what my tablet should.No swype. I know, I know. It's a tablet. But sometimes I just want to use swype when holding the tablet vertically. Swype isn't installed, and you have to buy the app. Doesn't work for me.Those are pretty much my only flaws. I do love this tablet and I don't regret purchasing it at all.",1/9/14,1

Now he is on it constantly, much to my dismay, as I like to get my hands on it occasionally.  He watches movies, listens to music, reads newspapers, plays solitaire, bridge and Sudoku, and now has an email account.  He is absolutely amazed at the quality of display in HD.

72674,The best Kindle yet,Ronald G. Glover,R11Y0SSS2UC93W,"I am a voracious reader, as is my wife.  We each have Kindle E-readers.  She likes her Paperwhite Kindle very much, but when I had one, I did not care for it.  I borrowed my Granddaughter's first generation Kindle Fire and liked it, so bought a first generation Kindle Fire HD.  I liked the concept, but had so much trouble with failures with them (I had and sent back 3 of them), that I got to know the tech support people pretty well.  I kept the last Fire HD I had since it semi-worked.  Finally, however, with much trepidation (and a $50 one day price drop) I purchased the new Kindle Fire HDX.  It has proven perfect.  It has not crashed nor given me blank pages or any of the myriad problems I had with my Fire HDs.I had read of complaints with blue/purple borders on the HDX, but I did not see it with mine.  My wife said she saw a faint blue tinge at the edges, but it was not bothersome.  I use my HDX almost exclusively for reading and I prefer the black background with white printing so blue/purple borders are not an issue anyhow.I think if you have been disappointed with the first generation Fire HD you will be pleased with the HDX, at least as an E-reader.",1/28/14,1

112312,Great Android Tablet,Cook,RXGT6BE2RV4K9,"This is my third Android Tablet (after the Motorola Xoom and Asus Transformer Infinity).  As you would probably expect from a newer device, this tablet is much nicer than my previous two.  It does all of the standard stuff like e-mail and web browsing very well, but where this tablet really sets itself apart is with the pen features.  Being able to accurate write on the screen has allowed this to be the first tablet that I can really use for note taking at meetings at work.My only complaint is with some of the software that comes pre-installed on the tablet.  I just don't have any use for some of it, but Samsung has the tablet configured where you can't uninstall most of the pre-installed stuff.",2/22/14,1

The dedicated Volume buttons make it a lot better then my prior standard Kindle Fire.Emails, Facebook and other Social Media works without any issues.Web Browser works well, prior Kindle Fire would say need to update web browser, Amazon we need an update on the older Kindle Fire.~Joseph",2/1/14,1

111770,VERY Nice Tablet,"Whacko Wayneo ""lawayne""",R1CK68N6OYIVFG,"Not near as elegant a physical design as the Apple Air iPad, but the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 is reasonably well-designed.  The operating system beats the iPad hands-down; more complex to learn, but is so much more flexible and powerful.  Apps can be highly integrated with the Android 4.2 operating system, unlike the iPad.  I have a Samsung Note 3 mobile phone, and this tablet uses the same user approach and stylus technology.  Make sure you get the 2014 version of this tablet.  A minor point: I wish the charger port were in a different location as it interferes with fully using my case in all configurations.  Note-taking with S-Note is amazing; it is very functional and can save your notes to picture or PDF format for mailing to others. See my reviews for the case that I really like for this device.  I wish the ""menu"" and ""back"" capacitive ""buttons"" were closer to the outer edges to make them easier to use with my case, but this is only a minor complaint.  The fact that it (and the Note 3 phone) actually have a ""back"" ""button"" is so helpful, unlike the iPhone/iPad which does not have one.  I have no issue with the size or design/build of the stylus.  32G of internal memory, with the ability to add up to a 64Gb microSD card is far better than how an iPad designs their approach to memory. Also, you can configure the closing of an app when you swith to a different display/functionality which helps battery life.  Otherwise, I end up with a zillion apps running in the background, thus draining my battery.",2/27/14,1
30703,Awesome tablet!,E. WALLEY,R1NO4VZT4CY665,"I definitely didn't need another toy, but I bought it anyways. I'm a web developer and use it often for tablet testing. Otherwise, I love it for playing poker and pooping at the same time. Great purchase!",2/25/14,1
117670,"Light weight, great performance",KJoegg,R3BYVZCBK3EMC4,I really like the lighter weight and slightly smaller dimensions of the iPad Air. Holding the iPad with one hand for extended periods just got a lot less tiresome. It's surprising how much difference it makes. Performance seems about the same to me. I recommend the iPad Air to anyone who spends a lot of time on the move and holding it to read or work versus sitting it in a stand.,2/24/14,1

The product arrived earlier than expected in perfect condition. I've been using it now for 24 hours and my assessment is that it's exactly what we've come to expect from Apple - a product that feels great in the hand, looks great to the eye, and operates exactly as the mind would have created it.

One a side note, the Send to Kindle software on my PC is very useful to send documents to the Kindle for my schoolwork.",2/15/14,1
116411,Fully meets expectations,George F. Smith,RIBYND44K2AQV,"Bought this for my wife as a Christmas present, and she absolutely loves it.  She had been using an earlier iPad so was already familiar with tablet technology.  She uses it for reading, checking email, web browsing, and for taking videos of our grandson during his wrestling matches.  For some reason, iPads are popular among moms and grand moms for taking wrestling videos.  She then transfers the videos to her MacBook Pro, writes them to an optical disc and gives it to the coach for analysis.  Video transfers are achieved when she syncs the iPad Air with her MBP.  She keeps it protected in a pink Otterbox, which gives the iPad a completely different look and feel.iPad Air is thinner and lighter than previous iPads and comes with a sharp Retina display.  I don't know if it's the best tablet for your money.  I do know she keeps it close at all times, and though she doesn't qualify as a geek she's worked in software maintenance most of her professional life.  If she were unhappy with it she wouldn't use it.  From my perspective as her husband it's a winner.My one complaint about all digital gadgets is that they are not nearly as tough as the old HP calculators.  Out of the box the gadgets are beautiful but then you have to stick them in some kind of case if you want to protect them, and the cases are a different look altogether.",2/18/14,1

46245,bonuses in the package,"H. Toliver ""co-author""",R1RNDQI2GMSBNN,"I can't compare the Kindle Fire with other tablets, but having a previous Kindle and having made purchases of books and music from Amazon over the years, I was pleased to find these readily available.  They wouldn't have been of course with another brand of tablet.  I bundled the Kindle with a stylus, headphones, and a carrying case that props up for viewing.  These enhancements make both listening and reading easy and convenient.  The sound quality for classical and folk recordings is excellent.  I happen to have heard several of the folk singers in person and noticed that in other replay systems something is always lost, both from the voices and the instrumentation.  With modestly priced earphones, not so on the Kindle.  The back lighting makes reading about the same as having a book in hand or a little sharper.  It is easy to bookmark passages and return to them though not to cite them by original page reference.  I usually use a computer for internet searches, but the Kindle serves all right for that and keeps track of website history.  It doesn't of course have all the tools of a good browser.  All told, I'm very satisfied after about 6 months",2/27/14,1

This was a mistake since the money I spent on 2 prior cheaper ones could have been applied toward a higher quality one from the beginning and I'd be money ahead.  I've always had success with Samsung products, so should have gone this route when I first bought her a tablet.

58755,"Love the iPad 4, but buyers should be aware that buying from Amazon is not the same as buying from Apple",Bria Burton,R3G61F195V5BM9,"The iPad is fabulous. Received as promised on 2/19/13. But before I even opened the factory-sealed packaging, I called Apple support to verify that the serial # (which was visible on the outside) was not registered to another Apple user.I had read in some of the reviews that people thought they were buying brand new iPads on Amazon, but received used ones. When I spoke to Apple, the person on the phone, Abby, was very helpful. She stated that the serial # I gave was not registered to an Apple user. However, it was listed as purchased back in Oct 2013. I asked if that meant this was a used iPad. She said not necessarily. As I was buying from a distributor through Amazon (Xr Distributors was the one mine came from), it could be that they bought the iPads and resold them without any customer having used them in the meantime. The downside is that the 1-year warranty that iPads come with would expire in Oct 2014, taking away from the amount of time I expected to have a warranty.I contacted the seller to let them know what Apple said, and they replied to my query within two hours. John T., who was listed as Operations Manager, apologized in the email for the inconvenience and said that all their iPads were brand new factory sealed. If I wanted to return it and buy one directly from Apple I could, or he would give me a $25 credit for the inconvenience.I really appreciated the gesture and opened the iPad to find that it was brand new, never used, and it's such a wonderful product. I'm glad I chose the 32GB as well because I shouldn't have to think twice about space issues. I also love the retina display.I'm very happy with my purchase, and I replied to the seller that I would absolutely be keeping this wonderful product and would take the $25 credit, which I'm assuming will be toward Amazon, but I won't know until I receive it I guess.",2/24/14,1

71039,Great tablet if its in the $200 range,"keo ""Get the best deal, then get disappointed...",R3AVTPQB5Z2CML,"This is Excellent for the price.  I've owned one for close to a year, and its the perfect balance between a 5"" and 10"".  Most people won't be happy with the resolution of the screen, but I think its just fine especially for taking notes.  Speed is fine for browsing and writing, although at times it can have trouble with intense games. I've owned the new Note 10.1 2014 version, and the Note 2, and I actually enjoy the Note 8.0 much better (to each their own) than either of them.  Yes the 10.1 2014 version has a nicer screen and higher specs, but if you're using this tablet for Note taking or drawing, higher everything also meant draining the battery quickly.  I just shut off the Wi-fi, turn down the screen to 35-50%, and I'm set for hours in school. Also, although the new S-note has nice new shiny excellent features, there is obvious lag in the pen, and you can't use detailed erasing when drawing like the note 8.0.  In erase mode, once you touch the current piece you have written, the eraser will remove EVERYTHING.  There are no settings to remove this.  The Note 8.0 uses very detailed erasing, and writing is very smooth.For those that are wondering if the Note 8.0 is good for taking notes at school, I'd say yes.  I've used it through 3 hour classes no problem,  and its easy to write and erase things during class.  Once I hit 60-70%, I attach a portable battery to it and juice it back to 100%.  Place the tablet in landscape, and its easy to write.  Pinch to zoom for detailed writing and you can pan around the screen using the same two fingers while dragging them along to the spots you'd like to view (at times it feels like an old type writer when pulling the page back to the beginning of the next line).  Its great for kids to practice their ABC's, just be sure to properly protect it and keep an eye on the S-pen.S-note is decent, but I prefer using the app Lecture Notes.  It costs $5, but well worth the cost if you like to customize your note taking and download PDF's to write over.  I sometimes download Coloring Book PDF's for my niece to draw on and save myself from buying books and crayons.  Its also great when a professor emails PDF's for class because you can highlight important information.  I'd sometimes ""white out"" terms, study the content, then remove the ""white out"" portions to check if I was correct on the term.  Its and excellent tool.In the end, its all about personal preference.  I like the balance of an 8"" tablet, vs bigger or smaller versions.  I think I spent too much money at the time I purchased this gadget, but if the tablet is in the $200 range, I'd say its worth every penny.  Spend time with it, and you'll be very happy with this device.",3/7/14,1

I have downloaded books, browsed the internet,  do facebook, taken pictures, and downloaded a texting app.  I have done all of this with little or no difficulty considering I am not very tech savvy and do not have a cell phone. The only  negative I have about the kindle fire HDX is adobe flash player is not available for this or any newer device, but haven't really missed it that much. A lot of things from youtube will still stream, as upgrades are made.  Some videos from Facebook play while others do not, but if it is something I really want to see I look on my laptop.

The ASUS Tablets have always been my favorite products anyway, they come 2 different cloud storage programs one with 8 gb and the same. The video player that is built in is awesome, if you need to go to your home page then back to the movie it shuts down but when you hit play again it starts were you left off perfectly. The battery in this tablet is crazy long lasting, I watched 3 movies and played games for an hour and still had 35% or more charge left to go. Wifi has awesome reception and audio is good too. The HDMI MICRO cables I bought at Best buy cost $53.00 and are worth every penny.The higher the quality of the video the better.  I have tested every connect and app that is built in and few that were downloaded, and I love this Tablet.

78449,Loving my first table!,"Gary G. Gilmore ""JJ48Fan""",R1RF0LWB028FEJ,"I spend 6-8 hours on a computer every day. I work from home and have a desktop & a laptop going at the same time in my office and another laptop in the family room. I didn't think I would ever like a computer without a regular keyboard. I have an iPhone and those who know me would tell you my text messages are very short. I have big fingers and I just can't do what I see many teen agers do when it come to texting. I think many of them can text faster than they can talk. Anyway. this is much easier to use for responding to email and such. But that is NOT the only thing that I like about it. I love being able to get my Prime movies and TV shows on this. I am hard of hearing and wear hearing aids. I use close captioning on my TV. I used to have Netflix, but when they went to the streaming they didn't have closed captioning. I let them know my need and they said they were working on it, but it was never available for anything I wanted to watch, so I cancelled. It has been hard for me to use the Amazon Prime Movie downloads on my TV. I have to run it through my laptop into my TV and Prime downloads didn't show closed captioning. So I was delightfully surprised that everything I have been watching on my Kindle from Amazon Prime has closed captioning! I like the larger screen and the picture is amazingly clear, crisp, with great colors. I keep finding new useful apps to download. The battery seems to last a long time. I know it lasts a lot longer than my iPhone. This thing is very light in my opinion, but it is my first pad computer so I don't have anything to compare it to. I have come to prefer taking it to client meetings over my laptop. There are probably others more geeky than me that might want some things that the Kindle doesn't have, but I love mine just the way it is.",3/4/14,1

122860,"After the update, it's perfect",L,R18VWJ9D1Z57LL,"I upgraded from an Asus transformer Infinity 10.1. I also had a Nexus 7"" 2012 (too small for me). I bought this to see if I could consolidate both sizes into one that would be big enough, but still portable.  I think the 8.4"" does a fine job at this, but I wouldn't say that if the screen resolution was subpar. Samsung's screen is top notch and makes even the smallest text readable.So for me 8.4 is doable, but only if the screen is high end, which the Samsung's is.It's also noticeably faster in general and especially in loading web pages than both my prior tablets.  This is another thing I wanted in my next tablet, and I'm satisfied with the speed.I also like the included IR blaster for controlling my TV. It has become an integral part of my couch potato command center :) No need to take my hands off my tablet to reach for the remote anymore!There is one problem though that knocks a star off for me. As also mentioned by one other reviewer here, the screen is overly sensitive at times. When I try to scroll a webpage in my browser or a pdf document in Mantano reader it will zoom in or out instead. So it's interpreting my scroll movement as a double tap. Scrolling through youtube videos will sometimes result in it playing one when I didn't select it, so it's interpreting my scrolling motion as a tap.Of course this happened on my Asus and Nexus too, but no where near as often as on the Samsung. I bought a stylus, the amPen 3 in 1 Hybrid, thinking it might help, but it is actually worse than my finger. It also skips when trying to write with it. Same with an old Griffin rubber tipped stylus I had. The amPen stylus works perfectly on my old Asus transformer though, better than a finger.I've spent hours trying to come up with a solution to this, and I did find a few things that help. First I noticed that it doesn't happen very often if I use my ring finger to navigate my tablet. My index finger and middle finger are the problem. I examined my fingers to see what could be different and came to the conclusion that my ring finger is smoother/softer than the other too. So I got out some very find sandpaper and sanded my fingertips. That seemed to help.I also did a google search on adjusting touch screen sensitivity. One hint which seems to make a big difference is to adjust the press and hold delay. Go to settings, device, accessibility, press and hold delay. The default is 0.5 seconds. I changed it to 1.0 seconds.The third thing is to clear RAM in the task manager. I notice when I first power up the tablet everything works fine, even the stylus works beautifully and scrolls and writes like a dream. After 10 minutes or so of use though it stops working. Clearing RAM can usually get it working again temporarily.So I think something is loading that affects the screen. I haven't loaded any apps that aren't also on my Asus and as I said, the stylus works fine on the Asus. So I think it's either some Samsung bloatware running in the background or 4.4 Kitkat. Asus hasn't upgraded to Kitkat yet.So if a guy has to sand his fingertips to get his tablet to work and can't use a stylus that works fine on an older tablet then the tablet probably doesn't rate 5 stars. I like the Samsung. I've got it to work with my fingers, but it's not perfect, so I'm giving it a 4.UPDATE 3/17/14:Reviewer Joe C gave some tips on how to improve lag for the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition tablet. Here they are""LAG ISSUES CAN BE IMPROVED, READ HERE:Turn on developer options by tapping ""build number"" found in the ""about"" section within options 7 times. Once developer options are turned on, scroll down to window animation transition animation, animator duration and turn each one off. You will notice no more lag for scrolling and exiting apps.To solve the home button issue where there is lag, go to S voice. Once in S voice, hit the menu button which is located left of the home button. Choose the option to ""not initiate S voice by double tapping the home button"". You will notice considerable changes in speed of the home button to wake up the screen, however it won't be snappy until there is an update.In addition, the more apps you have on your device, the more cache data your device will accumulate. Just like your web browser, you should remove your app cache data once a day or every few days to save up space. I suggest AVG memory and cache cleaner, or clean master. Also I highly suggest you install an anti-virus software like AVG on your Note 10.1 2014.""I did the developer options tips on my Tab Pro 8.4"" and also set my browser to delete cache on exit (I use NB browser pro). These tips helped remove most of the stutter I sometimes see when scrolling webpages. It also helps with the stylus problems I've been having.Turning on developer options comes with the risk that your tablet might not work right in some cases, but I haven't noticed anything bad with changing the above settings.Update: 3/19/14:Installed Clean Master to manage my RAM and cache and I think it made a noticeable improvement in my screen issues. CM also deletes junk files. I had uninstalled a mail app the regular way through the tablet's settings menu. CM found additional files that Samsung's uninstaller left behind and deleted them for me. If you install and uninstall lots of apps, over time you'll probably accumulate a fair number of junk files. CM says it can find most of these. Here's a link to it on Amazon. Clean Master It's also on Google's Play Store. Note: Be mindful of what you are doing. CM will delete your photos, videos, etc too, if you tell it too. It doesn't do this by default, and it takes extra steps to do so, but you do need to pay attention.Also, if you are having touch screen sensitivity issues there is a thread discussing it on XDA Developers you might want to read. You can find it by searching forGalaxy Tab Pro 8.4 screen sensitivity - xda-developersUpdate: 5/13/14My tablet received an update a couple days ago, which seems to have resolved the screen sensitivity. I haven't noticed any of the prior issues with sensitivity since the update. The stylus now works well and I prefer it over using my finger. So I've changed my rating from 4 to 5 stars. If you like this screen size it will be hard to find a better tablet than this one at this time.",3/10/14,1

93438,"If I could give it 5 and a half stars, I would!",B. Roth,R3LI0X1O4NUTFD,"I researched tablets extensively online before purchasing this one.  There was a certain budget and size I wanted to stay in, and when all was said and done this fit the bill.  I was taken aback at some of the reviews I read about it being slow or dying all of a sudden.  Of course I don't have a crystal ball, but as to the latter I'd say if you purchase a tablet with a lithium battery and certain sensibilities, it's good to take the time to read and heed the instruction manual and treat it accordingly, especially regarding charging. If I'm not mistaken (and I don't think I am), it comes with a one-year manufacturer's warranty. All this aside, compared to other tablets in the same class, Samsung's build quality and reliability seem unparalleled.  If it just up and dies on someone, I'd say it' s a manufacturing anomaly and not the norm.  People misuse and mishandle these tablets and then complain that it's junk, but I do believe there's more to those stories than meets the eye.Anyway, the funny thing is that I used my husband's Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 to do my research.  This was over a period of a couple of weeks, and as I went along searching and researching I came to like and trust the little gizmo.  He's had it for over a year now.  No problems!  It runs like a medium-grade laptop.  Sometimes it will take a second or two to go from one web page to another, or sometimes (I think because it's so small) you have to tap a couple of times to hit a link just right, but please.  Come on.  That's not slow.  That's not horrible.  That's fine.  It's good quality.  It's a Toyota.  It's not a Porsche.The display is beautiful.  The sound is remarkably nice, nice enough to listen to without a bluetooth speaker while you're puttering.  Both ways, depending on your preference at the moment, it works great.The Dolphin Browser, I find, is awesome to use on it if you dislike certain mobile apps as do I.  You can add your favorite websites to your speed dial and just go there.As for it running slowly, again, treat it as you would a $400-$500 laptop.  Clear the cache and make sure you don't have a jillion apps running all at once.  The Active Applications widget  and Clean Master app are awesome for doing this very easily and quickly.I've only used the camera a couple of times, but for casual picture taking I'd say it's quite good!  If you want something fancy, buy a camera.  Duh.In summary, if you're looking for a portable, reliable (and, I must say, very attractive and well-built) tablet you can carry around with you to watch movies and TV shows, check email, play light games, listen to music, visit your favorite websites, read, chat, Skype, etc., etc., you really can't go wrong with this baby!  It's not an iPad, and it won't open your garage door or wash your dishes, but it is a remarkably versatile device, and I'd say it's priced well.  Amazon's dropped the price lately, so keep an eye on that.  It's comparable to the price of the Lite version (which also looks excellent), but why get lite when you can get full fat?I could not be happier with my purchase.  If that changes, I'll let you know, but I don't think it will.",3/12/14,1

I have compared it directly to a 2nd Gen iPad and it blows the iPad out of the water when it comes to performance.  The display on the iPad is clearly much better than what you get on the G-Tab but it still produces a great picture and smooth fluid motion for HD video.I have installed XBMC, PLEX and a number of other demanding applications on this thing for testing and it has breezed through them all.  It streams video with ease and produces a great user experience for those looking to have a true hand held media player.  Skype works exactly as you would expect and the 10"" screen is great.I highly suggest this tablet to anyone looking.YOU WILL NOT find a better tablet out there under $200.",3/18/14,1

I love the ability to highlight, write notes, etc. on books and PDF files.  I also like that there is a ""on device"" and ""cloud"" app storage so I can move apps to the Cloud when I don't want them for a time.  It's very light and easy to handle.  I like the swipe texting, also.  I'm not bothered by the special offers.  It's allowed me to catch some deals I may not have noticed otherwise.  It's ways to buy apps.  While the app store isn't up to par with Apple, it's been just fine so far.  There's Candy Crush, which is important, of course :) I own an iPad, too; but it's too big and heavy for me to read and use for school work.

The screen is excellent (comparable IMHO to the HDX).  Love that you can upgrade the memory (which I did).  However, just know that apparently you cannot utilize prime books on the lending library with the Tab Pro....Amazon only lets you utilize the lending library on their devices.

I thought the slow download on the 2 was because of our setting - videos were out, pictures took a long time - so when we got the iPad 4, I was pleasantly surprised!  We can watch videos, download stories and generally just peruse the internet while not putting it down and doing something else while it loads!  The picture is marvelous, clear and sharp!

91891,Mayday feature is un-freaking-believable,Purple Yo,R2HLH2UYLD1YZJ,"So, I'm having some trouble getting used to this kindle since I'm used to apple products, and I wasn't sure if I had the patience to learn it until I discovered and used the mayday feature.  I'm so sick of searching message boards every time I have a problem with an electronic device or electronic service of some sort.  When web-based technology works well, it is amazingly convenient, but when there is a problem with something you've come to depend on, it is so hard to get help.  Especially with a 2 year old tugging at your...everything.  However, the Mayday feature of my new kindle is fantastic.  To have a person who can hear your voice answer your questions immediately, and solve your issue within seconds is just invaluable to this busy mom.  No more email back and forth conversations with customer service reps that didn't read the entirety of my message or didn't answer my question fully, necessitating a problem solving session lasting for days.  A person and a voice that can respond immediately is a breath of fresh air.  I would have given the Kindle HDX 3 or 4 stars before using Mayday (mostly because I prefer the Mac look but and feel and probably should have bought an ipad mini) but this service is just so impressive and beats having to go to a genius bar and wait in line for 45 minutes or more that I'm completely sold on the Kindle.",3/17/14,1

I got a chance to try the 12.2 in work environment and I am completely amazed at the power of a large inch tablet. For reading documents/pdf/books this is awesome. Especially for students! First let us compare the PRO lines from Samsung. The regular Galaxy Tab series will be out in summer based on past trends. Love the Tabpro and will do updates within a month in more detail. I will compare first the TabPROs briefly, and then give a crisp overview of the popular Tablets in market now. Then I will do in depth into the current tablet itself. I feel this will give a good perspective and enhance your buying decision. I am sure you are looking at multiple tablets to determine which sits you. If you have any questions, do ask in the forum and I will respond within a day. My video review shows Temple Run 2, YouTube, GPS Navigon, Sketching among other things.The single most fascinating part of the TabPRO lines is the resolution. Astounding 2560 x 1600 on all lines . In comparison last year's Tabs have much lower resolution.key_specs: { model: resolution, ppi, CPU, RAM, Flash memory, SD_card, camera spec, weight, OS_type, size, charging/sync port type, GPS:y/n }Samsung Galaxy TabPRO 8.4-Inch {B,W},  WQXGA 2560 x 1600, 359 ppi, 2.3 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 quad-core processor, 2 GB RAM, 16/[32] GB Flash, microSD upto 64 GB,  8MP Rear + 2MP Front, 331 gm, Android 4.4 Kit Kat OS, 8.62 x 5.06 x 0.28 in, microUSB, GPS yes.  4800 mAh battery (best resolution on a tablet!)Samsung Galaxy TabPRO 10.1 {B, W}, WQXGA  2560x1600, 298 ppi, Exynos 5 Octa (1.9GHz Quadcore + 1.3 GHz Quadcore), 2 GB RAM, 16/[32] GB Flash, microSD upto 64 GB,  8MP Rear + 2MP Front, 469 gm, Android 4.4 KitKat, 9.57 x 6.75 x 0.29 in, microUSB, GPS: y, 8,200mAh batteryWow, a 12.2"" tablet now!

If you have doubts shoot me a comment, I can help!RESOLUTION:The resolution of WQXGA 2560 x 1600, and has a pixel density of 247 ppi. All the TabPROs are same resolution,  so we increase in size, the pixel density decreases. The videos were very crisp and text so sharp. The new Magazine UX interface makes the screen really pop. I was able to read magazines very easily. Aldiko and many libraries have teamed up and magazines can be checked out through the app. Resolution will blow you away.  This new Multi-Window UI that now supports up to four apps running simultaneously, each in its dedicated window. I was reading documents/manuals at work and the resolution and clarity is stunning.PROCESSING POWERExynos 5 Octa (1.9GHz Quadcore + 1.3 GHz Quadcore), 3 GB RAM. Very powerful indeed! I have played games/watched youtube videos and have seen no lag or any latencies. Though the chip is octa core, do bear in mind only 4 cores are active at a time. This is done for minimizing heat.PRO MEANS?Tablet is certainly is a productivity tool.  This tablet is touted as Enterprise-Ready Email/Microsoft office support through a third party app.  It also has Hancom office suite which is an office suite developer in Korea. Hancom Office consists of Hanword, Hancell (Spreadsheet), and Hanshow (Presentation program). Since there is Google office, I don't know if this will be any sell in the US and other countries. does all this sound familiar to you. Yes, you have it in your laptop!STORAGEThis tabpro comes in 32/64 GB configurations.  Having the expandable memory to 64 GB is the greatest invention since sliced bread. Well, putting bunch of video/audio/books on the SD card which is so cheap these days, the tablet suddenly has more memory with no lag observed.  With prices plummeting for 64 GB cards, it is a great boon. Put all your music, books, photos on the SD card and you have a powerful computer in hand always! I personally use the 64 GB microSD card on my mobile devices. Get this mobileUltra (SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging.CAMERA:Having a tablet is a plus on smaller tablets, though I hate the feature on 10 or 12"" tablets.  I personally don't use cameras as much on 10""+. If you use publicly, it is like having a big magazine in front of you. Imagine the guy in the sports stand using in front of you! The resolution is 8MP Rear + 2MP Front. Video is 1080 p 60 fps. Nowadays there is nothing much to sat of cameras, they just work for the required purpose.ERGONOMICSI personally like for home uses 8"", but  at 12""+ this is truly a laptop replacement. At 717 gm, the weight is definitely not single hand holdable.  Still less weight than laptops. For example, 11"" MacBook Air weighs 2.38 pounds. Size of this tablet is 11.64 x 8.03 x 0.31 in. The battery is 9500mAh and it came for easily couple of days for me at nominal usage in an office environment. The best part I liked is the beautiful resolution and is the best resolution on a tablet! HD videos are crisp.  The tablet is marked as PRO which means Samsung us really trying the enterprise customers, though nothing prevents one from getting for home personal use.SOUNDExcellent sound system with stereo speakers and microphone. I was able to ask questions to Google Now and get precise answers.MISCI tested OTG capability and it is great to have a external USB support.  USB Host is one of the most undernoticed features of Androids and is in my opinion one of the best features compared to iPad lines. What this means you get a USB Host cable also otherwise called OTG (On the Go) cables and plug in your USB thumb drive or other USB devices and the device recognizes it. I have used it with Alfa AWUS036H for a wireless project with Android PCAP Capture from reputable Kismet wireless.Having a GPS is great for immediate needs and I could get immediate lock on this tablet. Wi-Fi is 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, dual-band. Also has infrared which cas be used for WatchON as a TV remote control. Worked straightaway on Samsung TV. This is also great for sharing your tablet with family members, multi user mode lets different users log in separately, so you each see only your own apps, backgrounds, and email.APP POWERI tried following apps and they just worked awesome. A tablet is only as good as the apps you have and how productive it makes you. It's almost like the camera/lens analogy in the DSLR space. What good it is to have a great DSLR body if you have no good lens? Same with Tablet body and apps you have. Apart from official tasks, I tried apps from my personal Google Play apps.WolframAlpha (I can go on for hours praising this. This is a truly genius app powered by hundreds of supercomputers in the background. Wolfram is a computational genius). Well worth the $3 price.Withings HealthMate. (another remarkable app great UI/UX). I use Pulse and the integration with it as well as Weight machine is very good.23andMe app (I love their reports)Aldiko Book Reader Premium (absolutely love it, many libraries have magazines for checkout)Amazon MobileAndroid StatusAndroid Central app (great and must have for Android users)Androidify (kids love it)Angry Birds (Space/Seasons)Asphalt Car gameBattery Monitor Widget Pro (a great app)BeyondPod (use it daily!)BoxChromeCNET TVDictionary M-W PremiumNAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps)TOM TOM app (has some advantages over NAVIGON)Google Navigation/Earth/Maps using a portable MiFi boxGoogle Currents (nice way to read News)Google Keep/Keyboard/Drive/Search/Books/Voice/HangoutsEbayFlipboardLinkedinGoogle Music (Awesome, I have now upto 10,000 songs halfway through Google's 20K Limit)Tapatalk HD (awesome forum browsing app)OverDrive Media Console: Library eBooks & AudiobooksMicrosoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good)Subsonic Music StreamerTerminal Emulator (still need to use vi, yes this is it)TweetCaster Pro for AndroidTwit.TvSkypeRealCalc Plus (Awesome calculator app)Wolfram AlphaZillowPlenty of WidgetsAsk questions, the reviews cannot do full justice.

68987,Didn't think...,"Linda Hall ""A truck driver""",R3IFGDEFCH5AM3,"I didn't think this would be any better than my old (well not really old only a little over a year) Kindle Fire. But, the 1.9"" makes a big difference. Plus the internet and the videos and games download much faster.I love being able to fling things onto my TV (I also have the Fire TV which is excellent). I can even fling my books onto the TV (though I was told by a rep that you can't). Since I make bread and like to try new recipes this is excellent. I can put the recipe on my TV and see it from the kitchen (set your Kindle to stay on for an hr or so).It also makes some of the games  more fun. Mostly the hidden object games, the action games can't be used on TV unless it's strictly for others to watch you play. But, the hidden objects are easier to spot on the TV.Also,  I would keep the special offers, I've found many good deals with the special offers and they don't pop-up.

Screen to screen, it has the better picture. More in-depth color, sharp images,  well defined textures and clarity.  Individual strands of hair in pictures seem to pop out, it's really amazing.

The closest device in terms of weight and size would be the iPad Air, but there's no reason to buy an iPad Air for almost 8 to 9 times more money, for marginally better experience. Once of the minor issues is the battery life. When watching movies, you may be able to get 6 or 7 hours. It's OK, but I know that the iPad Air does about twice this.

122770,Very Good Upgrade!,Chris Leach,R36MO7V7FYI5BW,"Ok, I bought my nephew the Galaxy Tab 8.0 for Christmas and have been using it and enjoyed it so, that I was about to buy the same thing for me.I seen that the GT Pro 8.4 had come out and had a better screen than the GT 8.0, so I thought I would study a little about it, read a few reviews online and then I would decide on which to get.I can say that I definitely chose right.Just some quick Pro's from my use so far :Width wise it seems smaller than the GT 8.0.Screen is heads above the GT 8.0The .4"" screen size is NOT noticeable at all.  My hands hold the GT Pro as well as the GT 8.0.Loads apps/books faster than the GT 8.0.  It should with a quadcore processor.The fake leather backing on the back of the GT Pro is nice, it isn't as likely to slide on any surface that is not flat.Charge seems to be holding up, but I have only been using it recently for reading books.The speaker seem good considering this thing really isn't being advertised as a mp3 player.Some quick Con's:When I slide my finger to go to another screen, it stutters at times. (haven't had time to see if there is a fix or not for this)The fake leather on the back just seems tacky and not right for the GT Pro.  I don't hate it, but it seems something better could be there instead.The speakers and sound aren't what they should be, in my opinion.  Maybe they should invest into Beats audio or some other brand of audio to up the sound quality.  The GT Pro, should have better sound, not just a better screen.This has been a pleasure to use so far, though I clearly have not put it completely through its' paces, I have used it and abused it a bit, and it does very well.I would recommend this over the Galaxy Tab 8.0 in a heartbeat.If you are struggling between the 2, the Pro is the one to get, even at the cost, but you can't go wrong with either really, but the Pro is a step up that you can see and feel.",4/10/14,1

61134,The best tablet at  $150,Souvik Pal,R3MKO3DOK4QI1H,"Bought this as a gift for my parents. What can I say about Nexus except that it is great! I don't have to re-certify the fact that its clearly one of the all time best 7"" best tablet ever sold. I have a iPad2 and in terms of silky smooth touch response, iPad is still may be a few points ahead than nexus, but my iPad2 cost me well in excess of $500 versus the nexus at $150, which raises the question is iPad really worth that much extra cash? This is the 2012 version, and the 2013 nexus is even better what I have heard. My iPad2 is showing signs of aging, so I will probably buy 2013 version as well. If you are looking for a 7"" tablet, this is the must have tablet. Believe me,  the other 7"" tabs are not worth the extra cash. I know in 10"" tab genre, Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 and iPad air are the major players, but nexus beats everyone else in 7"" form factor tablet market.The only major drawback with this one is that USB on the go is not enabled by default. You have to root it which may not be trivial for normal people.",4/17/14,1
122759,"Clearly the best 8 inch tablet, worth the price premium",Snowfall86,RBUA5C2XZFY6F,"After returning 2 defective Nexus 7's, I decided to take a look at the LG G Pad 8.3 and this Galaxy Pro 8.4. You really should get to a store and play with each before trying. The Galaxy Pro 8.4 is far and away the higher quality device...but it will cost you. It's about $70 more than the LG G Pad, but in my opinion it's worth it. This is not a ""budget"" once a year device. It is future-proofed to own for at least 2 years, with the fastest processors on the market and Android KitKat.PROS- Remember how it used to be fun to open a new computer? Samsung makes you feel good about your purchase - as of April 2014 they throw in $25 of Google Play credit, 2 years of 50GB Dropbox space, 3 months of SiriusXM App and Hulu, 2 years of remote desktop access, 1 year of in flight Wi-Fi...you get the picture. It's nice to be rewarded with a little more than a device and USB cable. Samsung is one of the top players in tablets, and you can tell companies want you to devote screen space to them.- Top tier specs. You will not find a better spec sheet on a tablet for the rest of 2014, unless you REALLY want wireless charging.- Premium feel. The biggest knock on design of previous Galaxy devices is the cheap, plastic-y feel. That's completely changed with the leather back. You don't have to use a case for this, since the back is the kind of material that won't scratch if you leave it on a table.- Obviously, the display. But you have to see it in person to believe. PPI's or brightness stats don't do it justice. Just look at it next to the iPad Mini Retina or G Pad...the Galaxy Pro wins easily.- 2MP front facing camera is a step up from most tablets for video callsCONS- As a Nexus 5 owner, the TouchWiz UI is annoying. It's not terrible (except for that keyboard, yuck! download Google Keyboard and use that), there are some decent features added, but would prefer the option of going stock.- Left side can get a little warm if you are using heavily for a while. I have read the internal temperature of the device is similar to other tablets, however the material on the back does not contain heat very well.So while the Galaxy Pro is about $70 more than most Android tablets in this size range, I believe the perks and quality of the tablet make it worth the extra cost.",4/7/14,1

No matter how much anti-reflective glare covers you place on them. But, I love the rest of it. I haven't used the ""MAYDAY"" feature yet. After all the pads I have owned, I do pretty good on this one. The one thing I love about Kindles is the ease of use. My husband has an Ipad, and we love it, but, a Kindle is a bit more ""user-friendly"" in my opinion. Especially if you are not used to APPLE. Love it!!!!",4/13/14,1
111750,Much improved over older tablets,Tennesseeuser,R3NXAC3FN957C9,"The processor is much better than the Toshiba I used to use.  It also can display more than one page at a time, which is a nice feature.  It has the annoying property of most tablets (thanks Apple) that there are apps you cannot get rid of, and even when you turn them off, you get a warning (probably not true) that turning this off might impact other apps you are using.  My guess is that it limits the amount of free data they can mine from your use of the tablet.  I'm sure there would be denials about that.And still a nice tablet, boots up fast, has many nice features,  Comparable to an iPad, and it has a micro SD port.",4/1/14,1
58062,IPad vs Samsung Galaxy,norma wood,R26XE4D1UIO4Q,I ordered Samsung Galaxy Tab.  Could not download movies from Amazon because unit needed flash player and flash player no longer on mobile devices.  Spent 2 weeks trying to get Google Play Store perk - never did get it. Assume support would be same.... So returned it to amazon & got Apple iPad.  I absolutely love it.  Have downloaded movies. & books.  Was so surprised & pleased with ease of learning a new system - I'd never operated an Apple. I can even print pictures from iPad.  A really amazing device.  I chatted with support re how to set up groups in contacts.  Patrick at Apple was fantastic.  Gave the link for group instructions which I printed right from the iPad.  It was a great experience with support. I HIGHLY recommend iPad.,4/11/14,1

I love the size of the device - large screen yet the tablet is nice and thin and light. The case that I got for it adds a very minor amount of bulk. As a new Apple user I was impressed by how easy the interface is to use. Since I have to store a lot of photos for my business, I purchased the 32gb model and I'm glad I did. Even though I store most of my stuff on a cloud app, I'm glad I don't have to worry about filling up my tablet.PROS:GREAT battery life. I literally had this on for 3 days straight during a convention and it was used constantly - just barely made it down to 20% battery by the end of the 3 days. Charges back up fairly fast tooScreen size is big but not too big, tablet is lightweight and thinEverything runs fast and smoothCONS:Cord of the charger it came with is very short (just a minor gripe, but still!)Screen gets dirty easily and I haven't found a decent screen protector yet (another minor gripe)Safari, the default browser, sucks.

Tha calculator is not located in the same menu as for an iPhone (the one when you swipe up from the bottom of the screen - I don't remember what it's called). This makes accessing the calculator, which I use a lot for work, very inconvenient.3. Many apps for the iPhone (Instagram, snapchat) have not been adapted for use on the ipad.

I like the size because it is very compact and easy to carry around when you are travelling. The battery life is not bad, but really depends on what you are doing which has a direct effect on your battery.My kids use it to watch videos on youtube and play some games.

When it is near dinner time I can take it with me to the kitchen, prepare dinner and continue watching my movie. It is so light and easy to carry. I really do not see why there are ANY negative reviews on this Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. The apps are awesome and I found some free books on facebook using pixel of ink. People have to be crazy to rate this little jewel any less than five stars. I highly recommend it! You won't be disappointed. Give yourself time to get use to it and learn all its functions. It has a ton!",5/30/14,1

83405,Great for those who travel often and live overseas!,Cristiano,R2ADYOQYG3QG05,"I got the Kindle Fire HDX 7"" (32GB) for my wife as a belated surprise birthday gift and she absolutely loves it! We've had Amazon Prime for awhile and we now get to maximize the value of Prime membership as the Kindle Fire allows us to access the growing selection of free movie/TV content!I'm a bit of techie and my experiences with tablets have been quite ambivalent. Here's my history:- Amazon Kindle DX (hated it b/c it was too slow, clunky; sold it on craigslist after 3 months)- Apple iPad 2nd gen (loved it at first but when I tried to use for productivity, it was horrible; sold on craigslist after 6 months)- Apple iPad mini (after playing with it at a store, I didn't feel it was worth it so when I got it as a gift I immediately sold it on craigslist and got the Canon S90 camera instead)Despite this disappointment with tablets, I thought the Kindle HDX was a good value at its price point and would make a great gift for my wife. So I pulled the trigger and let me tell you, my wife is so happy (I'm a bit tempted to get one for myself). The screen is crisp and rich in colors, the OS is fast, form factor is perfect for personal viewing, super light (very important when watching a 2 hr movie), all previous electronic Kindle books look great on it, and the chambray cover I bought for her looks great. Also Amazon Prime membership makes the Kindle HDX have so much more value than the more expensive Apple iPads. We live in Korea and travel a lot so my wife is looking forward to using her new Kindle HDX on long transcontinental flights (now that they allow you to downloads some of the content).In order to lift the geolocation restrictions, we purchased witopia VPN ($50/yr) and setup the IPSec protocol. It was simple and worked right away at HD streaming quality! Hope this helps someone! A great gift!",5/25/14,1

84488,"So far, it's my favorite device",a-train,R315MP0NIYDJ0G,"I gave is 5 stars because the device itself is solid. I went with the Kindle Fire HDX because the specs were the best out there for the price point that it's set at, plus I got a Prime member deal on it.Movies look amazing on it, the sound from the built in speakers were surprisingly good, and it has plenty of processing power to do everything you ask of it.The blue haze on the edge while viewing a white doc is such a NON-ISSUE. First of all it's only there on a complete white screen. Secondly, it's barely there, and you have to look for it. It's non in your main focal point, so you're never going to REALLY see it. I can't say this enough: It's very minimal! If no one mentioned it, you probably wouldn't even notice that it's there. The other things that the Kindle is great at completely overshadow this.The app store has plenty, and it's only getting more. With a little research you can get whatever Android app you want. For example, I like Chrome for web browsing, and I was able get the app on my Kindle in a couple of minutes.Being a Prime member, and able to download prime instant content is awesome. I don't have to rely on wireless connectivity to enjoy movies on the go.This was a great purchase for me. The only regret is that I didn't get the 32GB version.",5/9/14,1

Packaged well and even gift wrapped so you could just slap a bow on it if giving it as a gift, but I bought for myself. Note pad works well so far and has a good quality feel to it. Best thing about the product is how cheap it is. I can not believe how well it works for the price I paid !!!  I did not even pay anything for shipping and ordered it last Thursday and it arrived 4 days later on Monday, which was several days earlier than advertised.

I can just drop the movies (mp4 and MVK) and music on the external hard drive, plug it in the tablet and play. Simple and straight forward.

124141,"GREAT TABLET, GREAT PRICE!",jwstaton,R2DRMFHAWQNZEF,"This is my review of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 10.1. This review is not incentivized by Samsung in any way. I purchased the product for my own use.What is it?The Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 is the aforementioned companys latest foray into the midrange tablet market. With these tablets youre not likely to find a retina display or anything over 720p resolution, but theyre more reasonably priced, and therefore, more likely to be adopted by more people.SpecificationsProcessor: 1.2 GHz Quad CoreMemory: 1.5GBStorage: 16GB with additional microSD slotDisplay: 1280800Operating System: Android Kit Kat 4.4 with Samsungs TouchWiz UIAs you can see, those specs really arent too shabby, but theyre definitely not bleeding edge technology. However, having the latest and greatest isnt always the best. For example, I recently purchased the higher end Galaxy Tab Pro 12.2 and was utterly disappointed in it. Yes, the screen was beautiful but you could tell that not a lot of games had been properly coded for that resolution as the HD graphics appeared pixelated and blocky. Also, the Tab Pro suffered from massive lag and stuttering when when navigating through the operating system. You can read about my experience with that tablet here. It was promptly returned to Best Buy.Back to the Galaxy Tab 4.As mentioned earlier, it runs Kit Kat 4.4 with Samsungs custom TouchWiz user interface over top. In my opinion, this isnt a bad thing since I have never been a fan of HTCs Sense UI. It sadly still comes packed full of bloatware that I almost always remove if possible.Initial ThoughtsBeing an ex-member of the cult of Steve Jobs, I am still getting used to the Android world and the lack of high resolution displays in some products. The Galaxy S5, which I own, has the best display and form factor on the market right now. Are you listening Apple? Thankfully, there are cheaper Android tablets available that still offer a high quality user experience.Once you go through the obligatory setup screens and sync your applications, the tablet is zippy and runs with no lag whatsoever. Overall memory utilization is low when using several apps at once and multi-tasking.DisplayOK, this is a 720p display. You will notice a difference if using an S5 and then the Galaxy Tab 4  but lets not compare the two. The 1280800 screen is actually quite beautiful and bright. This is one of the brighter screens Ive seen on a midrange tablet. Text is sharp as are the graphics, both are quickly rendered thanks to the 1.5GB RAM and quad core processor. Yes, I think it should be a 1080p panel, but its a $319 tablet.PerformanceI was able to open apps and switch between them fairly quickly. This little tablet is definitely more responsive than its bigger, more expensive brother. Even under heavy use the Tab 4 performed excellent. Its able to handle video encoded to 1080p with no stutter, even though its obviously rendered at 720p on the screen. No complaints at all about performance.Final ImpressionsIm still an Apple fanboy, just now living in an Android world. I really like the Galaxy Tab 4. Its fast, responsive, light, and does what I need it to do. I feel like for the most part, I could ditch my laptop when traveling. That is, as long as Im not running a GoPro, or editing HD video.The display is not as sharp as I like, but the applications and games I use are not upated to be displayed yet at the higher resolutions on the Tab Pro.Kit Kat has grown, the OS takes up about 4GB of the internal 16GB, and by the time you add-in the Samsung applications and associated bloatware, you have only about 9GB of usable space. That almost sounds like a Surface tablet, no? LOL Sorry, couldnt resist. Samsung says the answer is to use a microSD card  which you will want to do immediately. They state on their site, that a maximum of 64GB is supported, although I am tempted to buy a 128GB and try it. I know those work in the S5.So, should you buy it? If you like new gadgets, sure. If you want a great performing Android tablet for a great price, absolutely. I cant really find anything wrong with this little guy. Its a keeper.UPDATEI pre-ordered the Galaxy Tab 4 on Amazon at $349. It was released May 1st, and it looks like the price was dropped to $319.99, making it an even better value.",5/2/14,1

I also use it for lots of meetings and on the ho stuff and the battery life is amazing. Yes it takes to charge but it is a 10000mah battery not a 4000mah as most laptops. Overnight charge is perfect. With all the application at hand it is a windows laptop comparison. Of course android has to polish a lot to be smoothy all the time and take office tasks 100% hopefully it will come soon. For the price and performance it is a 100% review. Slimmer than most of my uni books why not then a notepro?,5/21/14,1
