137918,Sprint Error 34,Jane Paulson,R9C4R6HIQLKM2,Have the phone with Verizon and Sprint. Sprint has said they have a text issue (Error 34) that there are delays / complete shut downs along the network. It varies among phones and the Samsung (on the Sprint network) appears to be more prone to this issue than other manufacturers - love the phone on Verizon - hate it on Sprint.,1/3/14,0

151953,If I could give less than one I would,RatedPGLV,R222ILH5NK3E12,"I've only had the phone for 2 months and now it will no longer turn on. I've never had a phone just stop working on me, especially one so new. Not to mention after I bought the phone the price went down by $10. I did read what other reviewers had to say and turned off the data so my bill was only $25 a month but Virgin Mobile is still cheaper as I paid that much and had data. The map system was very out of date. The phone was fun and had some nice features though the camera was just average if that. I did purchase a warranty with the phone but it's easier for me just to get another phone and I'll be going back to Virgin with a lesson learned.",1/1/14,0
47925,HTC A9192 Inspire 4G Unlocked Phone with Android OS 3G Support 8MP,SAM,R1THV4DE3YGF3B,"I bought this phone new, and to date although the os has updated, whenever Itry to update it I  cannot.  It wont allow me to personalize my ring tone because I cant use a saved song (like even the bb could because its too big)  I also cant listen to the preset radio stations I have.  Its one thing after another.  Amazon sends me to HTC and to date the so called experts at HTC cannot give me a workable solution to have my phone updated,  when I tell them to replace my new phone which I have had for less than six months they won't because its not in their policy. Even though its less than a month after I bought the phone I had reported the problems I've had with them",1/16/14,0

185255,Very Disappointed,Craig McDonald,R153C0FY762ICZ,"I bought this phone last year for my daughter who is currently living in Jamaica. The phone is no good as far as I am concerned and I should have tested it before taking it to her in Jamaica when I went on my vacation. From the very first moment the phone battery did not last an hour after the first initial charging process. Then it stated to freeze. It would not accept the Digicel sim card that they use in Jamaica and we had to take it to the Digicel office to have them fix that. I remained hopeful and my daughter did not want to part with the phone although it will never remained charged for more than a couple minutes even after been placed on charge for hours. I left it down there with promises to get her a replacement when I returned to the USA. The phone started to overheat so badly on her that her mother refused to let her use it anymore in fear that it may hurt her. It was sent back to me recently and now I am stuck with it and have lost my money. No one wants to purchase it even for parts and now I am hoping to sell it on EBay. I am very disappointed in this product and would never recommend anyone to these phones or attempt to purchase another of this kind. This is my second most disappointed product experience with purchasing a product on amazon. This is very unfortunate to know that I lost my money in such a hard economy that we are presently living in. I didn't even want to give this product the one star rating to show how disappointed I am with this product. I hope that they (Amazon) takes this off their website as it only makes Amazon look bad although not liable for the quality of this product, it still reflects on the company and the products and services offered.",1/16/14,0

129576,Not waterproof,rehanyf,R28OUCRN0PLN7A,Please don't buy this phone for it's water resistant properties. They wont work in the long run. My phone washed out in 8 months in spite of taking all precautions. since its a sealed device Sony can't repair it and since the indicators say water damaged Sony won't honor the warranty. I've given up after pulling hair with Sony Service - not what I expected of a $600 device and from a big brand like Sony,1/7/14,0

172103,PUK Problems,bird,R1ABAIIT3GEO3X,"Because the phone was purchased through Amazon, Motorola will not replace it.  Only repair location is a walk in basis only located in Texas.  The phone continues to have a PUK lock.  Motorola blames AT&T.;  AT&T; says the phone is defective.  The code(s) to unlock it do not work and I have to take it down to AT&T; - where it can take up to an hour to figure out how to unlock the device.  It will lock up if the battery is low, if the battery has just been charged, or just because.  Not happy at all with this phone.  And no one will accept responsibility for the defect.  So buyer beware.  Motorola does not have an appropriate support system in place, especially if the phone is not purchased directly from their dealership.",1/23/14,0
119315,AVOID IT,scott J lynch,R19BLEXEJYDAVY,"Looks nice has some good features but it ends there. I've had this phone for about 7 months and i initially liked it however, it is a power hog and even when idle it chews through the battery in hours so in other words it must be plugged in more than any phone i've ever owned. It can have a full charge and left overnight ,unused and it will be dead in the morning. This is one phone to stay away from not just the power issue but many other as well I just don't have the time to waste on this POS phone to describe them all.",1/7/14,0

80037,Um... no.,Sonia Chaudhary saffron_rose,RQQ9SNJBGEWID,This phone sucks. I have used it for almost a year and a half and got used to it but the biggest frustration is it's lack of internal memory. I can't download any apps because there is no room and nothing will move to the SD card. And now after a year and a half it has totally quit. It turns itself on and off every 5 seconds so finally I just took the battery out. I'm in the market for a new phone now and you can be sure I'm going to find one with enough internal memory to make it worth having a cell phone.,1/7/14,0

113526,Phone OK if it will work,Troid,R1UP7V7JWNEC5K,We purchased 2 of these phones in late September 2013. One was for a Christmas gift and was not opened or turned on until early in January 2014. It was at this time that we found that this Christmas phone did not work correctly (Wi-Fi did not work and the phone would not recognize the installed microSD card. Upon taking it to a nearby AT&T; store it was discovered that the phone was defective. Upon contacting Talking Tree (the store that sold it on Amazon) we were informed that the warranty was only good for 60 days. Amazon's A to Z guarantee could not help because it was only good for 90 days. Essentially we were told (via email by Mark at Talking Tree) that we were out of luck.,1/15/14,0

142530,Amazon Wireless Service Inadequate,2G8TRS,ROOMAMI7HN5IJ,"This review is about the Amazon Wireless relationship with Verizon.  Placed two orders for phones when Amazon ran them on sale and Amazon was only able to process one order.  Evidently they are not able to verify the upgrade status of multiple phones on a family plan.  Amazon automatically cancels the second line order and the only option is to resubmit order (after the $200 off sale, of course).  Even if your account shows up it is eligible to upgrade on Verizon's and Amazon's websites, don't expect multiple phones to actually ship.",1/31/14,0

70365,Phone Great for $50 - Comes With Many Flaws,DatapawWolf DatapawWolf,RDOURXZ7XDCOK,"So I recently purchased this phone since it can be used without a contract, and for $50: much less than any god forsaken markup Verizon has on amazon.It works great as a cheap, low end smartphone, but has many flaws, which include software and hardware, and so I cannot rate this higher than two stars.*Occasionally it will simply stop sending/receiving text messages. So far I have little idea how or why this occurs. This proceeds for any length of time and/or until multiple restarts of the phone*The battery life is poor. Any use of apps sucks the battery usage to less than a day. Skype alone will suck up the battery life in a mere 2-3 hours.*Sometimes the micro SD card stops being read. This was never an issue on my previous phone with the same card, and so I can only reason that it is a software/hardware defect.*The available flash memory is so small that few apps can actually be downloaded without an SD card to put them on, which then defeats the purpose of a smart phone. Not to mention there's no legitimate way to download larger apps, because there is no option to download APK/install files to the micro SD card instead of the phone flash storage.*Update - the screen will stop being responsive after seconds of being in cold temperatures*Update - its problems are getting worse. Messages fail to send with no information available consistently. I wish at this point I could rate it 0 stars. Waste of money.Overall, like I said, it's good for $50, but the poor quality of the software and hardware should never merit the current $75 asking price here on Amazon.",1/6/14,0
167236,I STILL DONT HAVE MY PHONE!Â¡!,Heather H.,R293SY3LTVUZW8,I never received my phone I ordered my phone on DEC.12th and I still have not gotten my phone...I emailed this company and they never answered back and its been almost 2 months now..it was a Christmas gift so much for that so I don't know what to think l would just like to know where's my phone or where's my money????,1/31/14,0

69083,Very disappointed with product,Timothy Richardson,RJWXHKPVCFJBH,"I bought this phone to replace my wife's other Samsung Strive that finally gave out after almost 3 years. We were happy to find this phone still available for purchase. It was sold as NEW, but we had problems with it the very first day, within minutes of turning it on. It shut off and we couldn't get it to turn back on. We let it charge overnight, and the battery showed a full charge, but in less than an hour, the battery was dead. We tried another battery. Same thing. We tried a different charging cord, in a different location. The phone just wouldn't allow the battery to charge or hold a charge. Then the  phone shut off and we couldn't get it to turn back on at all. We returned it. I don't believe this phone was new, but possibly refurbished. I was very disappointed with this purchase..",1/2/14,0

160542,The headphone jack placement ruins this phone,Amazon Customer,R32GPCGZB5QQ45,"I am giving the iPhone 5s one star for one reason only: the headphone jack on the bottom of the phone.  Apparently a lot of people like this feature.  But a lot of people also like 2 and a Half Men and CSI.  My point is, a lot of people are idiots.Seriously, this phone makes me irrationally angry each and every time I try to use headphones with it.  If I am working out, I have to set the phone upside down on the machine as I run.  If the phone is in my pocket, I am constantly flipping it over every time I take it out of my pocket.  That is annoying in and of itself, but it also causes the headphone cord to get tangled and shorten when I put it back into my pocket.  Also, it makes it difficult to work on the phone while listening to my headphones.  The cord sticking out from the bottom prevents me from using my pinky to stabilize the phone in my hand.  I almost never dropped my iPhone 4s in over two years that I had it.  I drop the iPhone 5s once a week because it won't let me hold it securely.I realize I should not care this much about a headphone jack.  Maybe some people get used to it.

132533,"Once upon a time,,,, there was blackberry",jake,R1QPS0N92S89ER,"They were good qwerty phones,,, but then they started making touch screen models. Thats when everything went downhill for this historic company.I didnt want to doug on blackberry, but this phone just begs to be ridiculed. And my main disappointment here is the user interface. It simply could not be more annoying to open up each app without any ability to simply close it. Blackberry went out of their way to break people's heads on this one. For example when using a calculator, once youre finished u must swipe upwards to turn it into a smaller little window,, and itll stay there to nag you until steam blows out your ears and u simply HAVE to press the  tiny little x to close it. There are no buttons like home back or apps to quickly change to different applications from any screen. So going from 1 app to another becomes a tedious chore that will drive you mad. But that's not all! Blackberry was kind enough to lock in their network settings feature, so even the unlocked versions you cannot easily change the APN for your particular carrier. Theres a whole process of doing it all through visiting some specific blackberry webpage. I could go on about how this phone does not even compare to the functionality of htc and motorola phones from way back in 2011, but its not even worth it. This company is done... and even if they continue trying, they will get wiped out like Sumatra. A small percentage of the market may continue to use them for the physical keyboards, but even that is becoming a thing of the past. So I will end this note with a simple GoodBye to Blackberry,,, forever.",1/23/14,0

I thought it was a glitch in my phone's address book, but then I had people tell me they tried to call me and weren't allowed.

No one you buy this phone from will have parts or can get parts. Poor design. I don't why they didn't use 4 screws instead. And the Cat website is useless.

177350,"Great phone until battery is dead, then it's a dud",LovesAmazon,R3ASEVYTO0X4TW,"Motorola Moto G - US GSM - Unlocked - 16GBMy husband bought me this phone for Christmas. I love it--except... the battery was dead and the phone would not turn on when plugged in to car or wall charger. My husband says, Having a reliable cellphone is a matter of life and death.  The Moto G is not reliable and will leave you stranded when you need it most.  When you perform an Internet search for Moto G won't turn on you will see what I mean.  When a Moto G battery discharges, it will not turn on.  At all.  Even if plugged into a charger for hours.  It will not charge and it will not turn on.  This means that if you have an emergency, you cannot call for help.  If you need to look up a phone number so you can borrow someone else's phone to use to call for help, your Moto G will not show you the number you need.  No text, no voice, no email, no contacts, no kidding.The secret to getting it working is to leave it alone over night, not plugged in, not charging.  After 12 hours of idleness, when you finally plug it in, it might begin charging.  At this point, the Moto G is still useless.  It will not turn on even though it has a few percent of battery life and is plugged into a charger.  Finally, when it has about a 10% charge, the phone will allow you to turn it on.  I have used cellphones for over 20 years and until now, I have never had a phone that will not turn on when it is plugged into a car or wall charger.  If the battery of a Moto G does not have a few percent of battery charge, it will not turn on.  Period.  Further, it will not begin to take a charge unless it is allowed to rest at least over night.  Some people report it must rest (not plugged in, and with no buttons pushed) for 24 hours.  However, if you want a cheap, fancy, unreliable Android, then this phone might be for you.",1/16/14,0

148506,Keep looking for something else..,K. Quaintance,R32Q1U1SIX60F0,"I liked it allot at first because it came with all the bells and whistles I was expecting in a new cell phone. I believed at the time this was a good upgrade from my older cell phone , with the slide out keypad , Bluetooth and a nice big screen. But after only three weeks of my purchase.. the battery would die within a few days on standby mode. I tried to take it back , but I just missed the 15 day return policy. A new battery would cost about $10 less than buying another new Sparq II phone at Best Buy for $39.00. Now I see they are only $25 her at Amazon.I would Not want to buy me another Sparq II considering I cannot text well with this phone to begin with , the pictures are okay but the video is very distorted. I mean really bad video quality.. that can't pick up sounds well , and provides a really cheesy terrible looking picture.  The reception is also not up to par. Example:  After a day at sea our ship came into Avalon Bay at Catalina island. I walked by a few people who were having a nice conversation on their cell phones so I went topside looking forward to talking with my Mom.  I could not get a single at all..  while everyone else was on their cell phones talking with  friends and family inside the ship. Then  I took my phone to the highest  most forward  part of the ship right next to Avalon Bay...I Still could not get a single.. This phone was a big disappointment and has let me down for the last time..  I almost wanted to throw my Sparq II into the ocean when I realized all the trouble it was causing me. I gave up and called my Mom on the ship satellite phone that cost me some extra $.  Although the main thing is the battery.. Now here we are two months later and the battery won't keep a charge for more than half a day in standby mode. My phone keeps shutting down...  and I would much rather buy me a replacement  cell phone rather than pay for a lithium battery that will cost as much as this cell phone does here on Amazon.",1/22/14,0

It looks like a google android phone and its cheap, that's it!CONSWhat the phone aka PORTABLE CHINESE SURVEILLANCE VIRUS PHONE comes with.1.  The phone looks like a Google phone on first glance, buts its far from it.  The phone comes in Chinese Language and most applications you can get in the United States are BLOCKED on this phone.2.  The phone is not recognized by the usb port when you plug it in your computer, but your computer will never forget this phone, the software on this phone takes over in the BACKGROUND.3.  If you plug an SD card into this phone and take it out and plug the same sd card in a real Samsung Galaxy S III, verizon(your phone carrier) doesn't even recognize what kind of phone you have anymore.4.  The phone has a factory reset button, but DOESN'T I REPEAT DOES NOT RESET THE PHONE.  The phone keeps all the information you put on it, including passwords, etc...5.  The phone says it is an S4 on it with HD video, has neither and if you try watching a movie on the phone you see your reflection the entire time.6.  This phone is worth at most $5 to $15 dollars, $90 dollars is too much to pay for this phone.7.  Having to replace other hardware and software that this phone comes in contact with costs far more than the savings on this phone.My Opinion, coming from someone that studied Computer Science:THIS PHONE CARRIES WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE CHINESE SURVEILLANCE CODE THAT CAN MOVE TO YOUR OTHER DEVICES...BEWARE....I really don't think the seller should be allowed to sell this on Amazon.The phone carries a virus and takes over anything it comes in contact with, that includes:  Bluetooth, Wifi, USB connections.

While it does have a few pros, they are, unfortunately, over-shadowed by a slew of cons. Buy at your own risk.Pros:+ Screen Size+ Price+ Looks GoodCons:-Slow; it often freezes or hangs while trying to catch up with me,-Poor call quality. People report that I sound like I'm underwater even if I have full signal.-Restarts randomly-Sometimes ringers and alerts do not work. Restarting fixes this.-Sometimes cannot adjust call volume.-Often phone dies without warning about low battery.-When researching how to root (to remove bloat), you'll find this can't be done.-This is nit-picky but I cannot dim the screen enough for use in dark rooms. The thing is blinding when used in dark even with brightness all the way down.Summary:If you buy this phone you are taking a chance. It has many issues.

After it was activated I had immediate issues I thought it may be my fault for not  understanding a smart phone.  I went to 2 co workers who had the same phone they said there was definitely a problem with the phone I couldn't download things and time after time the phone would reset my password.  I contacted the company they said they would replace the phone when I sent it back.  I got a email stating they received the phone now they asked if I had a tracking # etc... not the new phone is on its way its been over 3 weeks with NO refund or Phone.

Took it to the Apples Store ( a 180 mile round trip from my home) where they quickly brought it back by removing the battery and then replacing the same battery. ( basically re-booting)The Apple technician was able to tell me that the phone was originally purchased from Apple in mid 2012 at a store in Las Vegas and that it showed signs of having been refurbished.Given that supposition I would find it very hard to rate this provider other than one star.

My fiance had the Vivid at one point and it was amazing. We did our research, and read all reviews of all that we were looking at. IDK if the good reviews got lucky and actually got what they ordered, or if they're people who work for the company. I paid $189.00 for a refurbished phone, the volume buttons were completely worn, I got a used battery, the charging port was loose, and the plastic around it had been buffered. When I emailed the company the response was quick, and I was told if I sent the phone back they'd refund my money and compensate me an extra $10 for the shipping. When I clicked the button that said 16 new there was one to select out of them, the rest were ATT only. While I received an unlocked phone, it was not new. I strongly suggest you listen to my review and the others. We'll see how smoothly it goes for me to get my refund, which btw you should be covering the return shipment in the first place.",2/2/14,0

41515,Don't do it!,Tech-Duke Tech-Duke,R23BM8QZOGMCDD,"Try Consumer Cellular instead.I should have heeded all the negative reviews about Straight Talk. Because Walmart carries this, I figured it would be consumer-friendly because Walmart actually vetts their sources. If you happen to do all the procedures right for a new SIM card, you may be lucky and get some service and be oblivious to the bad system underneath.If you don't fully understand their procedures (which are not always worded clearly), and you make a mistake, then need to call Customer Service to get it corrected, then your misery will begin.I bought the $45.00 service as a test to see how it worked. After paying for the SIM card too, I am now out BOTH the $45.00 and the cost of the SIM and Customer Service will not give me my money back or give me the service which I never used.There is much detail to this story, and if asked, I will update it with the cronology, but safe to say that some SIM cards that are sent to you may already be activated and they expect you to use it immediately - even though they don't tell you this.Even though there was no usage of my SIM card, they took my money and will not give it back and will give no credit to the account. When I asked them who had activated the SIM card, they didn't know, they said they couldn't retrieve those records. When I asked them to look and see that there had been NO phone calls or usage on the SIM, they said they didn't know and couldn't retrieve the records. With so little access to records that would PROVE that the SIM was never used, their operation looks like a one-way set up - to their advantage. They can't help you resolve the problem in your favor because there are no records.BTW: Straight Talk is owned by TracFone which is a massive Mexican company, owned by the world's wealthiest man.See Wikipedia's page on TracFone:TracFone Wireless, Inc. is a prepaid wireless service provider that operates as a Mobile Virtual Network Operator MVNO in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands, TracFone Wireless offers its products and services under the TracFone, NET10 Wireless, Straight Talk, SafeLink Wireless, Telcel AmÃ©rica, Simple Mobile, and Page Plus Cellular brands.

I think Verizon and Samsung went out of their way to be deceptive on this one (I think it's mostly off the shelves now) with a stupid proprietary software system that will not interface with anything else, as I found out trying to transfer stuff via MicroSD. Nothing works quickly on this phone, especially the apps and the picture and video functions must be someone's idea of a joke. If you can take a bunch of pictures of still life and nothing else, fine. Anything else, use this junk for a wheel chock and go get a real phone. Forget about customizing the menu, too, while you're at it. Like a few other Samsung devices, trying to get an appropriate volume level is going to be an adventure. I never could get it at a consistently acceptable level.The one thing this does very well is take drops. Thanks to the overall design, I've dropped this thing probably more than my previous 5 (and now replacement phone) combined. It does not, however, especially take being a car door stop especially well. That seems to break the screen internally, though the glass front is still intact...for whatever that's worth.

So advice to anyone that has problems with there Google product... return it and don't agree to an exchange!  I should also note that I am, or at least was, a very happy nexus 7 owner until my difficulties with the 4 have changed my opinion on the nexus products and Google themselves.  I figured the company with the slogan don't be evil would understand my difficulties and frustration, since they are noted on my account, and would have helped me get a nexus 5 with some sort of deal, since I have had all these troubles or at least come up with some practical alternative that would help me get a working phone.... I should back up at this point and note that my nexus 4 is just about as useful as a brick at this point and I am stuck shopping for a new phone after only 8 months of ownership.I know a few other people with this phone and some would say that it is a great phone and I would have agreed with them it mine worked as well as my N7 tablet.  My 1 star rating has to deal with this product as much as the Google costumer.  I hope this helps future buyers of Google products!

131801,Worst phone & service EVER.,mika,R1W7ITKIRVXGOH,"What can I say about this phone?  I pretty much bought a $249 alarm clock...because that is the ONLY thing that worked correctly on this phone and I've had it replaced by the company TWICE.I have lived in two major cities in the last year of having this phone...you'd think this would guarantee good service and signal by VM. NOPE.  They have recalibrated my phone to my living area multiple times, and guess what?  No 4G service (EVER), no more than 3 bars (EVER), and the wireless NEVER works.  My calls always drop (if I can get signal to call at all), my texts never send (and I receive them 2-3 days late from other people), internet (wireless OR4G) is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SLOW.  Literally...it takes about two minutes to load Google results and another two minutes to load the page you want.Now onto the memory in this phone.  The phone I purchased had 8GB, I have external memory of 16GB on it.  Guess what?  The manufacturers apps (the ones you CANNOT remove) take up 5GB on your phone. YAY.  Worse?  There is no option to Move Application to Memory Card like the other smart phones.  You literally just suck it up and hope they install on there before you run out of memory in the first week of owning your phone.Now onto the VM service you will receive.  It sucks.  9 out of 10 times, you will end up talking to someone who barely speaks English and literally knows NOTHING about your phone.  When they replaced my phone, I called them to activate (you have to cal to activate) and I got this Indian woman who kept telling me that I cannot have my addresses from my old phone put on my new phone.  It's impossible. (Well, I'm pretty sure that's what she said, I couldn't really understand her).  I had done this on two phones prior, I know it can be done.  I kept asking her to transfer me to someone else...SHE WOULD NOT!  Are you serious?  She WOULD NOT give me to someone else!  Finally I hung up and called again hoping to get another person, and I did.  They were no help either.  CONTACTING VM is ridiculous.  You either have to call and go through a maze of non-English speaking people, or you have to email and sit and wait about 5 days for a response from them.  There is no talk now option online (like Verizon), you literally have to wait for days no matter what.Online pay per month never works.  Every month my payment was set to pay automatically, EVERY month they have a problem with the payment (which by the way, they stop your service TWO DAYS before your bill date, and EVEN IF YOU PAY YOUR BILL they WILL NOT activate your plan for the month til the day of.  So....two days a month you have NO cell service) and you have to log in online and click PAY NOW like 5 times till it works.So. Good luck with Virgin Mobile.  Honestly?  You're WAY better off with Verizon's $50 Prepaid plan.  The good service and GREAT coverage is worth the extra money.",2/12/14,0

I bought the phone 3 months ago, and the headphone jack stopped working, and the top 1/3 of my screen does not activate on touch. The phone never felt sturdy, and I was warned that LG was not a quality brand. The phone looked so nice that I wanted to give it an honest shot. To make matters worse, LG will not cover the cost of shipping and expects me to go without a phone while the factory figures out what is wrong with mine. Its only been 3 months!!!! and none of these problems are due to misuse or negligence. It has been in a case since I first got it, and the headphone jack has been rarely used.Bottom line: nice phone, terrible build-quality and bad support.I would not buy this phone again, it doesn't matter how awesome the phone is if it doesn't last more than 1/8th of the way through my 2 year contract.",2/17/14,0

133437,"Ordered a new phone, but was sent a used one. Amazon remedied the situation ASAP.",L. E. L,R2FPU0IZPLU9OO,"I recently purchased what was supposed to be a brand new phone. I noticed after I opened it that the clear protective stickers on the outside of the phone looked like they'd been reapplied. They had bubbles under them and dust. Then I noticed the seal on the outside that says do not accept if this seal is broken had another one underneath it, so clearly it had been broken and replaced once.Amazon immediately replied as they fulfilled the purchase (from the seller Top 10 Cell). They kindly offered me the options of a full return,  an exchange for a new phone at the same price, or keeping the phone at a 30% discount. I did decide to return it, as I didn't trust it at that point. Amazon was VERY helpful with this. If they hadn't fulfilled the item, I would have had to go completely through the seller for help.  The seller themselves contacted me after I left them bad feedback. They wanted to tell me that they open the phones before sending them out to be sure all of the accessories are in the box. Clearly that makes no sense for a brand new phone, for obvious reasons.My previous phone was the Galaxy SII, which I loved.

125020,would not buy again,Yachtwork,RQ3G31AT9OKJH,I have had this phone for about a year now and find the phone poor. Worst is when side by side an I phone or the Samsung S4.For example the camera focus is poor and often I end up with blured photos. The macro is particularly bad. The volume of the phone is low and I struggle to hear. This in itself is a deal breaker and there are many forums with various tips but in the end the volume is low and to hear I have to jam the phone against my ear. The hands free brings a lot of complaints from the people listening. They saythey can't hear or can't understand. I have tried this hands free feature side by side with an I phone and the nexus 4 is WAY worse. The audio when playing music is also low and when listening on earphones I always say Is That It?And the worst of the worst is the super short battery life. We are always charging the two Nexus 4 phones and they never make through the day. So we carry external charging blocks.When we put out a bunch of android phones together we can make them all connect except for the Nexus 4 for some reason. This is to transfer files or photos.For some reason nobody makes a waterproof case for the Nexus 4 nor some of the other normal accessories.In the end there are a lot of good phone and this one is just so so. Hope that helps others make a decision.,2/19/14,0

74562,"Arc S - Low quality phone, with Android OS",RS,RTYUQOZJOCXJ8,"The keys don't respond to the fingers properly, it is virtually impossible to key an SMS message without errors. The spelling check of the words in any language, is most times wrong and messages have to be corrected 5-6 times before they become correct. A lot of intensive keying, much more than with a normal dumb phone.The worst phone I've ever had, very low quality. It was a waste of money (more than 300 Euros, 380 USD), that could have been used in a quality product from the competition. The Android system doesn't help, as most of these problems are a combination of hardwarde and software flaws. Applications are resource intensive (lots of memory and processor hungry) and low quality in general. I bought three Xperia (two ARC S and one Xperia X) for the family and it's the same low quality and problems all over. Also due to the ARC design, the phone cannot stay flat on a table. When you press the screen it moves and doesn't stay stable (but this is not the reason why it doesn't accept the key entries.

I had to find this the hard way out after spending several hours calling each of the stores and then the support.Its been 4 months apple launched the phone 5s and you guys tell me to shell 269$ to get a new phone.

40689,Did not like at all,Bethany1985,R1HI41S2Q49UE4,"I purchased this phone because my husband and I jumped onto my parent's family plan (it was actually right around the same amount we were paying each month but this also got us data usage.  Otherwise we were just on a basic phone plan).  Since my contract period wasn't up yet (my parents were with Verizon just like us so our contract periods carried over), I needed to purchase either a used phone or find an older style phone to use that was brand new.  Not even 2 weeks after I received this phone the power button sort of broke so that it didn't pop out again.  I was still able to turn the phone on and off on my own, but I REALLY had to press on it and hold it down for a couple of seconds.  I could've sent it back to the seller but they would've just fixed my phone and mailed it back to me and I really didn't want to go through the hassle of being without a phone and sending it back.  So I kept it because really, I'm not that picky about phones.  After a couple of months, my phone stopped letting me add/delete contacts.  Pretty soon after that, it wouldn't even let me click on a contact's name to see their information.  Anytime I tried, it just returned to the home screen.  If I wanted to make a call, I had to first pretend like I was creating a new text message, then I had to copy their number and call it, or attempt to use the voice command service to say that I wanted to call a specific person, but sometimes that would back out on me as well.  I also had some other issues with the camera not saving the pictures correctly.  It would say that it took the picture but when I went in to view it, it had said that it wasn't a viewable file.  SOMETIMES it would magically work again after I restarted my phone but there was definitely a good 6-8 week period that I wasn't able to get my camera to work at all.  I'm still not sure what finally got it to work.  Anyway, I purchase this phone last year in April and I now have a Samsung Galaxy S4 and its MUCH better!  My husband got so sick of watching me attempt to do something as simple as make a call.  I thought it was pretty funny....in a really annoying sort of way.  Basically, I wouldn't recommend this phone to ANYONE.",3/25/14,0

I checked the phones and saw that, as I thought, data roaming was not turned on. I called Sprint and was told that although data roaming on iPhones may be turned off, it still uses data roaming and that you have to turn ALL roaming off. Seriously?! We live in the woods and I need my phone. The problem isn't with too much voice roaming, just data, but I can't use voice, either?! Nonsense! This is a problem between Sprint and Apple, not me. Sprint sold me the phones, Sprint sold the plan at this address, and now Sprint is mad because we're using the phones.Screw them, they can go ahead and drop me, I'll go to one of their competitors who are doing a better job than they are, in terms of coverage, anyway.",3/7/14,0

I'm truly sad as I had my hopes up so high as to replace this phone I love this brand so dearly. And I'm not sure what this means but the phone keeps telling me that a format has been downloaded and updated but there's an error in the format process.. what is that!?

177565,Stopped charging after 5 months of use.,Petra,R3I1RM1IYGW5X3,"This phone stopped charging after 5 months of use, never dropped, never damaged.  Because it is made in China, one must contact Samsung customer service in China to get help.  Samsung did not solve the issue, tough luck for me.  During the time it functioned, it only received 2g and sometimes 3g from Tmobile.  Also, the phone's activity combines calls and text messages together, and despite lenghty efforts I could not separate it into just calls and just text messages.  The phone does not have a notification light for text and emails, and it was generally slower on commands than its S 4 bigger version.  I bought it for the double SIM feature but I regret this purchase.",3/30/14,0

147432,Regret getting this phone...,AJ,R1D5R19C72QOZ0,"Virgin Mobile has been great, and their pricing is hard to beat! Unfortunately, the Samsung Galaxy Ring is frustratingly bad. I've had mine for just over 6 months. About 3 months in I had to ship it back to Samsung for warranty repairs because the phone crashed and NOTHING would get it back online. When I mailed it to them, I included a note asking that they also check the speaker because it would squelch and phone call were often hard to hear. Well, presumably because that wasn't in the initial work order, they didn't do anything about the speaker. Now I can barely have any phone conversations because the squelching is so bad when the other person is speaking. And my only option is to ship it to Samsung for additional repairs. Yeah, that it tremendously inconvenient, not to  mention I still have to pay for the phone service for the 7-10 days that Samsung has it. I own a lot of Samsung products (e.g. refrigerator, two televisions), but I will never buy one of their phones again.",3/27/14,0
159362,I regret upgrading,AV,R3GZWV0GG5K5TU,"I had iPhone 4S. It was a fantastic phone. Fast, responsive, nimble, well built, solid. Just the right size for my hand. My right thumb reached top left corner of the screen.Why did I upgrade? Who talked me into it? Why didn't I talk to other people that had a 5s already? It is an oversize phone that is not quite a phablet yet not convenient to operate. Something has gone wrong during screen manufacturing and/or calibration. Screen is so sensitive to touch - sometimes it thinks someone touched it when nobody did. Took the iphone 5s to Apple Store, got a replacement - same issues. Apple store tech politely explained that my apps are buggy. Not really. Glitches all over the place with standard apps only, nothing 3d party.I want my iphone 4s back",3/15/14,0
85363,"Stay far away from this company, I got scammed",Gulf Coast Livin Rob,R36RLC4FB3TZLN,"I cannot emphasize this enough - stay far, far away from this company.  I purchased this product from a Walmart store for my elderly mother.  I was unable to activate device.  Called customer support and this is where the real nightmare began.  After a long wait, the first rep was unable to fix the problem.  So, she put me on another long hold for technical support, who was also unable to activate the product, doing nothing more than the first rep to attempt to remedy the problem.  After a total of 2 hours later, I was told I must call back the next day because the would need to check with Verizon to see if there were any issues in my area with coverage.  Now keep this in mind, I spent all this time with them on setup and the phone on my VERIZON wireless cell with 5 bars of full coverage, of which they were made aware.  After over 2 hours of setting up online and dealing with reps who did nothing more than the manual suggested, I decided to return the defective product, as the rep told me maybe the product was defective and I agreed.  I returned the item to Walmart for a full refund.  I called the company to inform them to remove my mother's credit card information from their system and remove the activation charge of $26+ (since they were unable to activate the product) and I was told there would be a $10 RESTOCKING FEE!!  I told them Walmart does not charge a restocking fee and that is from whom I bought it.  They told me Walmart will send the item back to them and since they have my mother's credit card info, they would only refund the activation fee less the RESTOCKING FEE.  This is theft.  I never bought the product from them so they have no legal right to do this.  No matter what I said the rep told me 5 Star would deduct this fee from the activation charge.  I was absolutely infuriated and stunned.  This was one of the biggest scams and ripoffs I have been a part of.  The rep tried to force me into receiving another device by mail at a $10 discount (the same price as online vs. in-store).  Because of the terrible experience with the reps and the activation, I was concerned this device would not function properly when my mother needed it.  Now this isn't over because I will be forced to file a dispute with my mother's credit card company in order to receive the full refund.  NOTHING LESS THAN SCAM ARTISTS.  The reps have been trained to be sweet and smile while they kick and push you to the ground, acting as if everything is wonderful while they scam you.  I can't imagine how many elderly folks they are scamming.  It's just disgusting.  Run from this company.  Even if your device is activated, you will not regret the decision as they will find a way to scam you in the future if they can.  John Walsh and companies that carry the product should be ashamed for selling this product sold by such a shady company.What's next...a response from GreatCall telling me I should contact them so they can discuss this situation...",3/22/14,0

I needed a replacement phone and this seemed to be my best bet. The product claimed to be factory new. I had it working for a little over a month with a few hiccups which is usually normal with any phone. However, this one progressively got worse. It would shut its self off in the middle of calls, texts, apps, ect. Finally the phone shut its self off and would not turn back on. I fallowed all trouble shooting from apple and nothing worked. Today, I took it to Verizon (my wireless provider) and they told me that the phone was in fact refurbished, the battery was put in wrong and had started to corrode. They said it was fixable, but only for a hefty price. Needless to say, this is probably the worst thing I have ever bought and probably the worst company I have ever bought from.

I wonder, how a refurbished phone could be with a defective wifi AND a non working speaker? I wonder if this phone was refurbished at all and if it should even be on the market.

You used to get more service time than that.My old phone absolutely died and I could not recover any information from it.  I know it had service into early 2015.  That is gone. Tracfone reset my service to 1 month when I purchased this thing.  Also, not all of the time remaining was transferred to the new phone.

168293,Samsung removed the lock screen camera widget!,ezjay,R2YQ3A819DG56C,"A great piece of hardware with some ridiculous software flaws.If you build a device that is supposed emphasize its camera capabilities, you would expect that it would be easy to get to the camera, right? Well, apparently Samsung doesn't think that way.1.5 generations ago, on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus, without unlocking the phone, I can take photos. Just push the power button and swipe to the left to make the camera lock screen widget appear. Here we are, 2 years later and we've taken a step backward.The only way to conveniently use the most important feature on the Galaxy S4 Zoom, its camera, is to completely disable the lock screen. However, that is not an option for anyone who cares about the data on their phone, the accounts it has access to or accesses corporate email with their phone. Oddly enough, you can't even use lock screen widgets if you choose password, pin, pattern, etc. Basically, anything other than swipe to unlock disables the option to use lock screen widgets. If you like your SoundHound lock screen widget, that also won't be an option here. Really weird.It's a very disappointing software flaw on an otherwise awesome piece of hardware. I hope Samsung will release a software update that resolves this!Update: I have noticed the device often wakes up in my pocket. This is strange given the tiny power button is well designed and very hard to accidentally press, but it turns out that Samsung decided it would be good to have a hardware home key that also wakes the device up and not offer any option to disable this. So if something is pressing on the face of the phone, the phone will wake up. It also happens that the face of the phone is where the emergency dialer is. After pocket dialing 911, I am officially upset about this software flaw too.I hope Samsung is listening and makes the minor software fixes to correct these major deficiencies.",3/15/14,0

181124,Beautiful Phone but not very Fast or App Friendly,Neal Kinney,RCJ4YO5BQNRRP,"I can't really complain because I knew what I was getting into by reading the other reviews of this phone. I was just surprised at how limiting the processor speed and memory capacity actually was. As a phone with a few simple apps, it will probably work nicely. If you can get a larger app from the Play Store to download in the limited space (even with a 4GB SD card installed) you will, depending upon the game, not really be able to engage if fully because of the slowness. (read 'crashes a lot'.)  On the positive side, this phone, with it's two sim card slots, is quite beautiful. Looks just like a Galaxy s4.  A very nice finish. Photos are fair to poor (use lots of light and forget the flash). Can you use it as a phone. Yes, with reservations. I did not put a sim card into it. Instead I used the Groove IP App that takes advantage Google Voice and made several free calls over the internet. Because Google will soon be discontinuing this service, I tried another App that also lets me use the internet but through my Ooma telephone service. This also worked nicely. Both apps let you use your contact list from Google to dial out. The downside of this for me is that incoming calls go either to Google Voice or to my home phone on Ooma. The best way to use this device as a phone is to purchase and use a sim card, provided the company you choose will let you connect at the 2G speed that this phone is limited too.",3/8/14,0

The first phone's camera flash and flashlight app didn't work properly or at all at times. I emailed the seller and she emailed me promptly within 24 hours. I had recently transferred my number and service and really needed a phone. I asked the seller if she would send me another phone since it takes so long to receive it in the mail and once I received the new one, I would send back the defected one. She agreed and did just that. When I received the second one, it seemed perfect! Everything on it worked properly...at least the flash did. First of all, I went to a relative's funeral and took pictures of family members that I hadn't seen in a while and when I later went to retrieve the pictures, none of them were saved to the phone nor my sd card. That was very upsetting. Besides that, when I would receive a call, the phone would completely power off and immediately back on several times within a single call. Even in the middle of the night when I would charge it, it would power off and never come on unless I take the battery out then power it on. However, when I contacted the seller once more about the issues with both phones, she offered a full refund once I return the 2 phones...which was a great thing on the seller's part. I really liked the style and size of the phone but the experience was disappointing, especially the second time around...Guess that's what happens when you try to get a $600 Samsung look alike for only $200.",3/29/14,0

145377,"Nice phone, but poor quality and even poorer customer service.",Jen,R2W8E950H1CVB3,"Let me make myself clear: initially, this phone is fantastic.  The screen is big and easy to read; I had no issues with any sensitivity on the phone, and the phone itself came with a ton of accessories (phone case, charger, wall charger, headphones, etc).  However, the appearance of the phone does not excuse the quality of the hardware's performance.  I got my phone in November, shortly before Thanksgiving, and by Christmas, it had stopped charging unless I positioned the charger a certain way. (I was NEVER rough with my phone.) By the end of January, it had stopped charging altogether. Because it comes with a warranty, I was able to send it in. I sent it through express mail on the 11th of February and only just today, March 28th, received it back - thanks, I'm sure, to the fact that I sent an aggravated e-mail. The customer service is downright awful.  There was no communication whatsoever on the status of my phone and, even when they finally e-mailed me back on the 20th to ask me if they could replace my phone (it took a MONTH for them to decide they were going to replace it, by the way - a month!), they didn't answer me back until I sent an e-mail a week after asking if they were going to replace it or not.  I've just received my replacement and not only is the phone dirty - the screen has smudges and fingerprints all over it, and the case it literally caked with grime - but there are dents and nicks all over it.

When I received it, I took out my SIM card from my old phone and put it in to my supposedly newly unlocked phone, only to discover that the phone did not recognize the SIM card!! I thought maybe I was not doing something right. So, I took the phone in to our telephone service provider who told me, sorry ma'am, but this phone is locked. I ask the technician if he was sure and he said yes, positive.  I noticed that the phone also had Telcel which I know is a telephone service provider in Mexico.  I didn't really care about that, I just wanted the phone to be unlocked.  It is useless to me right now and so I am returning this phone. I will never buy from Mobile Best Seller.

Then after about three weeks, the SD card began dislocating itself. Just today, I had to open my phone up and reset the SD card four times. It just keeps slipping out. It doesn't matter what I do, even if I leave it on the counter all day, it still dislocates itself. I tried to return the phone but was too late because of it's one month return policy. Now I am a disappointed customer who wishes that the return policy was longer or that they made exceptions. The seller is also impossible to reach. There is no button to contact him or her. Although this phone is great, the SD card cuts my service 3-4 times a day and I wish I could have gotten something or a seller that was more reliable.",4/6/14,0

157179,stay away from galaxy note 3!,Paul McDonald,R4K02S5X9SRTH,"So, I got this phone using Verizon Edge program - ordered over the phone. When I received it, it wouldn't activate. The SIM card number wasn't on the order. I had to pry the SIM card out of the Note 3, which is NOT an easy thing to do! I had to do this to read the SIM card number to Verizon Wireless, so they could activate it.I noticed that when I had device on maximum brightness (NOT on Automatic) and was working on something over extended amount of time, the brightness would dim for a few seconds, then return to max. This would keep happening, at random intervals, and to seemingly random brightness levels. If I continued still to use it... say after 45 minutes or something, it would dim to MINIMUM brightness for few seconds.Now, it wouldn't show me or tell me in any way what brightness level it was changing to... I could just tell when it was putting to MINIMUM brightness. I got it replaced for another Note 3... The replacement had same issue... I called Verizon Wireless and then they revealed to me that this was a feature built into device by the manufacturer. I even spoke to Samsung to verify this.So, stay away from the Galaxy Note 3 at ALL COSTS! ANYONE that owned this device might need to operate the device on maximum brightness for extended amount of time... I mean, why have a long life battery, quad core cpu, and 3 gb RAM, if you can't fully utilize them? So, this phone does this to prevent overheating. Why would a $700 phone have a problem with overheating!?!STAY AWAY FROM THE GALAXY NOTE 3!",4/3/14,0

The only OK things about this phone are the Kit Kat update, picture & video quality, and camera flash. Other than that I can give you potential buyers 2 reasons NOT buy this phone: 1) No SD card slot (i thought I could do without, but I can't ); 2) no mobile hotspot. My LG Optimus Exceed can be used as a Hotspot (Verizon just enabled this capability) and so can the low end LG Optimus Zone 2 (on verizon's website for 49.99).  I knew not to expect much considering the price, but the Zone 2 is half the price of this phone with more capabilities. Too bad I can't send it back.

144723,"This review is about the seller, D&E; Fashion",LA friend,R1SYAWF1TTBLS0,"The phone itself is fine so far, but it's only the 2nd day and it came in an unsealed box!!!  It looks new.I think it's no fair to Blu product if I gave one star, I have to say it clear this one star goes to D&E; Fashion, the seller.  They deserve no star; one star is for responding to me at least.I meant it is ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS that the seller made decision to hold the item at the Fedex office for NOT DELIVER to my home until I emailed them because its already passed it's arrival schedule.Eventually, I had to ask someone to arrange a special ride to pick up the phone for me from Fedex office.  My expectation to D&E; is a total lost, but NOT AMAZON; however, if Amazon gives D&F; a free hand to dealing with customer, I think it is dangerous, because they could do whatever they want.  D&E; said is a two-days free shippment, but end up 5 days with no reason and no advance notice for customer pick up, I had to pick up the cellphone myself!!!Also, at the beginning, after placing the order, I received the order confirmation c/o Amazon, then D&F; sent email saying that they need my full name which I don't have any problem with my name for shippment before, anyhow, I emailed them right back with my full name, one day later, they emailed saying that they are out of stock and tried to sell model 5.5s to me, I accepted, but they didn't mention the price different which model 5.5s is $15 cheaper than 5.0 until I found out at Amazon myself and they are willing to credit back.I kept checking my order status and it arrived on the 16th april morning, however, no sign of delivery until 18th april in the afternoon.  I emailed D&F; and the reply is I HAVE TO GO AND PICK IT UP FROM FEDEX OFFICE.  All in all, I am speechless and disappointed.Now that the phone's camera is not working properly, might be I might need to consider returning it for no more hassle.My point is Why they could make a decision not to deliver the phone to me???",4/19/14,0

145290,Phone Could be Fine if Support Policy was not AWFUL!,Rob,R13A1L0JGFC4DJ,"UPDATE:  After 8 days and not hearing back, I called Blu support.  They said that an email was sent, but I did not receive it.  It was not in spam, or deleted either.  They forwarded the email and here is the turnaround time for a warranty repairThe average turnaround time for all repairs is fifteen (15) business days, but in extreme cases the repair process may take a maximum of thirty (30) business days.You are reading that correctly.  15 - 30 business days.So unless you are good with being without a phone for 1 - 2 months.  DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OK, lets start out by saying I am completely aware that all cell phones have issues.  I currently have 6 phones within my household.  I have have had dozens of phones  Every brand has had a problem at some point in time.I applaud Blu for taking the path of creating an affordable phone that satisfies 95% of what people actually need.  But they have one fatal flaw to the model.  Support!The Life Play that I purchased just 4 short months ago had an issue with the SD card reader.  No matter what card I put in, it says the card is bad and asks to reformat.  Again, these things happen.Here is where the problem begins.  I called in to support and waited for about 30 minutes to speak to someone.  The person was friendly and seemed knowledgable.  The took all of the necessary information, IMEI, Model, part number, problem with the phone etc.  They said that they would be submitting a claim to RMA/Warranty.  Again pretty standard.  He then said that he would send me an email to confirm and that I would here back in 24/48 hours.I received the email which asked for all of the same information, again.  I sent it back immediately.  30+ hours later I had not heard anything, not even a reply that they received the email, so I called back in.  I waited 45 minutes on hold then spoke to the same person who said that they just submitted the claim to RMA/Warranty.  I received the email which states that it would be 3 business days before I here back on the RMA.  So now the process is taking 4 business days to get an RMA answer.  I asked to speak to a manager and waited for an additional 15 minutes.  The manager said that I need to understand that they are the new guy and do not have the infrastructure to support a higher level of customer service and this is the best they can do.So....If you have and issue you will Submit your claim.  Wait 24 - 48 hours to see if your claim is valid, Wait 3 business days form RMA to respond.  Send the phone to them 3 days.  They look at it maybe another 3 days.  They send it back another 3 days.  Grand total:  UP TO 14 BUSINESS DAYS (ALMOST 3 ACTUAL WEEKS) TO HAVE YOUR PHONE FIXED!Morals to the story:1.  If you need a phone with responsive support, this is not the phone for you.2.

118898,"VERY SLOW RESPONSE, manufactured elsewhere and as such, no tech support whatsoever",Anna,R1IHZARNY7SOY4,"I purchased this phone unlocked so I can use it where I live in Central America.  A few days of having it and using it, I noticed that the reaction was very slow, but didn't take it too seriously.  It turns out that after a month, it really is a very slow reacting phone and I want to understand why.  To open an app, it takes about 15-20 seconds for anything to react.  I thought the phone would offer good value for the price, etc...it turns out that you really do get what you pay for.Worst of all, I contact Samsung Tech Support (which is what Amazon suggested) and they traced my IMEI number and the model.  It turns out it was manufactured in Pakistan which means I have to call Pakistan to get any sort of technical support, which is a huge deal if you're living in Central America.It's frustrating to find a phone, trust a retailer, and find out a the end that the phone isn't even working right and worst off, you can't even find a solution to the phone's problems.LESSON:  FIND OUT WHO THE MANUFACTURER IS before making a purchase that could require some sort of technical support.  The Seller also noted that the phone used a micro SIM card, it does not, it uses a regular sim.  I already had a micro sim which is why I targetted a micro sim card phone.  This review is also on the Seller in that they didn't disclose the info correctly or doesn't know their products enough to know that even if it was a manufacturer error -they weren't aware of it.

This left me unable to make or receive phone calls which is, oddly enough, the entire reason why I own a phone. The first phone took 3 weeks to exhibit this problem. It's been two weeks, and so far the second phone has not exhibited the same behavior. SO FAR. It does however, use Nokia's Windows Phone App for desktop, which is the clunkiest and ugliest app I've ever had to use.TL;DR I still love the Windows OS, but Nokia's hardware and software leaves MUCH to be desired.",4/10/14,0

I had to lay it a certain way just for it to charge anyway. The headphone connection was always bad, the sound was distorted only when headphones was put in the phone.  It's also very slow and freezes all the time.  It deleted one of my apps and wouldn't let me add it back.  It said that the phone didn't have that much memory left, but when I checked it the phone said it had a lot of memory left.  If your taking pictures outside, the camera is fine, but when your inside with flash, you have to be in a well lighted room.  The front camera sucks! The battery life is fine as long as its on standby, but of course if it's hooked on wifi and you're surfing on the internet the battery will run down faster. I loved this phone at first, but now I see it was just a waste of money.  I would not recommend this phone to ANYONE!!!",4/19/14,0

When I got the package, I was supper happy. I rushed to open it only to find out that the phone wasn't in the box. Only the charger, headphones, and a flip cases and a phone battery. I was so mad at this point. I had high opens for this. I bought cases and everything to the phone just to have to get my refund for them. I then contacted amazon for them just to be no help what so ever. They told me to send the package out, wait a week till they get it and have there team check it. I was not going to send just a charger and headphone and flip cases out for nothing at all. So I hung up the phone with that man. And because I had no phone to call them on because before that I used my moms phone. I had to chat with someone, just to let you know this was an hour or so later, but longer story short I talked to him for a half hour or so and he ended up giving me a refund and now I only have to wait 2 to 3 days for that one. and he also contacted the sellers that I got the cases from and told them what happened and why I don't need the cases.",4/3/14,0

AND EACH phone we have received under the warranty program had cameras that would not work.  The local ATT store saidWe are sorry but...( fill in with whatever lame BS reason) The ATT phone line did exchange out the phones quickly but gave us no other options but to continue exchanging the Z998 over and over and over and over....  They want to charge me full price to get another make of touch screen phone (and not a very reasonable price either).  So go ahead and pass on this one and get something far far away from ATT.

157397,STAY AWAY FROM GALAXY NOTE 3!,Paul McDonald,RVXD89BWW3K3R,"So, I got this phone using Verizon Edge program - ordered over the phone. When I received it, it wouldn't activate. The SIM card number wasn't on the order. I had to pry the SIM card out of the Note 3, which is NOT an easy thing to do! I had to do this to read the SIM card number to Verizon Wireless, so they could activate it.I noticed that when I had device on maximum brightness (NOT on Automatic) and was working on something over extended amount of time, the brightness would dim for a few seconds, then return to max. This would keep happening, at random intervals, and to seemingly random brightness levels. If I continued still to use it... say after 45 minutes or something, it would dim to MINIMUM brightness for few seconds.Now, it wouldn't show me or tell me in any way what brightness level it was changing to... I could just tell when it was putting to MINIMUM brightness. I got it replaced for another Note 3... The replacement had same issue... I called Verizon Wireless and then they revealed to me that this was a feature built into device by the manufacturer. I even spoke to Samsung to verify this.So, stay away from the Galaxy Note 3 at ALL COSTS! ANYONE that owned this device might need to operate the device on maximum brightness for extended amount of time... I mean, why have a long life battery, quad core cpu, and 3 gb RAM, if you can't fully utilize them? So, this phone does this to prevent overheating.

Save your money and put it towards a decent phone from a name brand manufacturer.Long Review:I bought this phone as a temporary phone after I sold my top-tier Android phone. I simply do not understand how anyone can give this phone a good rating. I'm guessing all of the positive reviews are from people who have never actually owned a decent top-tier android phone; or this was their first smart phone. I bought this phone because the specs made it look half-way decent. It boasts 1gb Ram (for processing), a 1200 mhz dual-core processor, a 5 megaixel cameral, and a 4.5 display.This phone is a perfect example of how specs on a sheet of paper are NOT the same as actual functioning. Long story short, the phone is VERY slow and gets hung up all the time, despite claiming to have a dual-core processor and 1 gb of Ram. It's quite comical when I read the reviews saying this is a fast phone. It's anything but fast. It simply can't handle much. It even freeze up as I scrolled through my home screens! Pathetic. I actually still have my 5 year old iPhone (that has much less specs than this phone) and it never got hung up like this. It was just so frustrating to use. Loading emails was also super slow and annoying to have to wait 30 seconds to a minute for the phone to load a simple email. And yes, as it did so, it would also get hung up or stuck sometimes in the process.The camera is also horrible. Takes very bad pics; very grainy. The screen is just okay...until you look at someone else's phone and see how gray and grainy it looks. People who say it has a nice screen have never owned a decent phone before. Walk into a store that sells real phones (e.g., iphone or galaxy) and you will be amazed how good they look compared to this screen.My biggest gripe was the slow processing and the bad camera. It got hung up and processed things so slow, I felt like running it over with my car. The camera is actually a waste of time. Don't fool yourself into thinking you're actually going to be able to use the camera and get good pics. I like taking pictures of my toddler and the pics were horrible.Oh, and one more major problem...the battery is horrible. Another lie. It claims to have a 2070 milli-amp battery, but it would fly through power in no time. There was once when I used the phone to check the internet and email, and within 40 minutes it went from fully charged to completely dead!",4/8/14,0

As stated in the manual the phone is featured to be waterproof and can be immersed in depths of between 0 to 100 cm for up to 30 mins. My phone fell in no more more than 2 inches of water for seconds. We tried immersing it in rice to draw any water out, but it still hasn't powered on. As such, therein lies my concerns.

85355,"Great potential, but could have caused a disaster",abigail a zocher,R10H4GWSIRZ4UT,"We have had 2 great calls for my elderly mom and dad; my dad was the account holder, and all the kids were emergency contacts. We were thrilled with them until last night. Recently, my dad, age 90 and with lots of health problems, has started to have memory issues,  and my mom fell and broke her back 3 weeks ago and is also needing pretty much full time support. We are in the process of helping him let us take over the bills, as this is a newly emerging issue. Last night, I checked both their 5 stars and neither worked; I got a recorded message from verizon (not 5 star) telling me to buy a calling card. For my parents, that would have been hopelessly  confusing, and they wouldn't have had no help if they had pressed the button in an emergency. I called 5 star, and they were nice, but said that the notes on the account were unclear, they couldnt understand them, and that there had been a payment 2 months ago, for 2 months worth, so even if there was a problem with the bill it was too early for it to have been cancelled normally. They told me to call financial services today. When my sister called them from across the country, assuming that the credit card info hadn't been updated by my Dad and eager to make a payment, the 5 star person wouldn't speak to her as dad is the account holder, which is understandable, but beyond that the 5 star person was extremely rude and unhelpful, which is not understandable.My concern is, that they shut off the 5 star devices without notifying the emergency contacts on the account. If they notified my Dad, he would not remember. Regardless, the night time 5 star person had told me she didn't know why it was shut off right now, as it was too early for it to have been shut down even if there was a non payment issue.Anyhow, I hate to think what would have happened if I hadn't happened to check the devices just by chance. They should make triple sure people are notified if they are going to shut off the devices, seeing as sick people depend upon them.",4/12/14,0

131635,Annoyed with it,Brian Gard Brian G,R2C73PDX788RP8,"I got this phone as an upgrade from my LG Optimus, have had it a few weeks and I'm not thrilled.  My biggest complaint is the lag time from when you touch an icon on the screen to when it actually opens.  It takes a few seconds, sometimes several seconds which might not seem like much, but when you press something and it doesn't open, it makes you think something is wrong with the phone. In fact, it's just incredibly slow to respond.  To me that's pretty annoying. And when you want to use the camera, it takes a long time for it to load and open.  The next thing I really don't like is how smooth & shiny it is. It might look neat, but it translates to being very slippery, which is especially a problem if when you use the Navigation, you set it on your lap as you drive like I do.  The phone slips and slides ALL OVER the place, and the slightest tap on the brakes will send this phone flying onto the floor where you'll have to retrieve it from somewhere near the pedals (which is quite dirty in my car).  My LG phone had a slightly rubberized surface which was ideal for a mobile phone, I guess I'm just so used to that.  Slippery plastic seems like the worst possible choice of materials to use.  The third thing that really annoys me is that the navigation feature was recently changed--the layout, the menu, how it functions, it's completely different.  Now they use Google Maps which is synced to your computer (did I SAY I wanted my phone & computer synched?  NO!).  There are a lot more steps involved when you want it to navigate somewhere, which is another annoyance when you're in your car and don't want to have to press a zillion things just to start the Navigation.  The way it used to be was much simpler & easier by comparison.  This isn't Samsung's fault I guess, but it does add to my overall frustration.  Lastly, when you first start service with this phone, it automatically shows your voice mail messages in text format. I think this is a free trial of this for the first month, but I don't like it and apparently there's nothing I can do to get rid of it until the free month expires, which I'm anxiously waiting for.  I can't even call my voicemail to retrieve my messages!  Ughhh!!!  And the vm text feature isn't always accurate, it misunderstands some words that people say in their message.  Oh and the battery life isn't great.  My LG Optimus had much better battery life. And the touch screen on this phone isn't always very sensitive when I touch something deliberately, which is pretty ironic because... ...This phone has a super-annoying habit of opening apps and windows all by itself, just by sitting in my back pocket when I walk somewhere.  This seems pretty hard to accomplish, because in order to open an app, you first have to a) press the button located on the top edge of the phone to turn the screen on, and then b) slide your finger across the screen to unlock it.  Only then can you start opening apps, email, etc.  But oh no, somehow this phone manages to do that all by itself just sitting in my back pocket, even after I have locked the screen.  Today I took it out of my pocket to discover that it had turned on the flashlight app all by itself.  Seriously?!?!?!Oh one more thing, it only has ONE alarm clock ringtone, which is another annoyance because I depend on my phone as an alarm clock in the morning, and the only ringtone selection they have is a very mellow melody.  Most of the time I don't even hear it, even when it's tight next to my head, so I use my old phone for the alarm clock.  Why don't they offer more than one measly ringtone for the alarm???  My LG had about a dozen.Judging by the reviews, a lot of people seem to like this phone.  I guess it's a matter of personal preference, but as for me, overall I'm pretty annoyed with it. I'd return it but the 30 day return window just passed.  Grrr.",4/28/14,0
170274,Worked for 2 Months,Michael D. Peters,R1FYEAYT3KN0VD,"I took a chance ordering this generic phone...regret it now. The phone worked fine out of the box, I have/had two issues:1) The phone ships with a leather case, but it is very simple...most will want a different case.  Due to the odd size of the phone (yes, it is slightly bigger than the Galaxy S4), I have been unable to find any alternate case that fits.2) Last week the phone began having problems, the screen is only partially responsive to touch.  I did some research which advised doing a factory reset...didn't help. Unfortunately, they only have a 30 day return policy.While it technically still works, the inability to navigate the touch screen without repeatedly touching an icon 6-7 times makes it a brick.  Looking for another phone now...perhaps it was just bad luck, gambled and lost $120.",4/6/14,0

180732,hindered by crappy touchwiz software,Wayne,R1S3G1CB2LPRAS,"I've been a Samsung Android user since the S2.  Over the years I've blamed much of the sluggishness, apps freezing, apps closing, etc to the design and coding of android.  I loved the S4 at first but once I started loading it with apps I noticed once again apps having issues and general sluggishness of the phone.  My observation leaned on widgets on the home screen running in the ui thread as being the culprit.  After talking to other android owners and researching on the net Touchwiz was pinpointed as the culprit of my woes.  Touchwiz is merely poorly written software that happens to be intercepting all the UI events and causing it to stall.  In some cases causes apps to freeze and crash.After my final months of frustration I began my search for an android replacement (I'd prefer IOS but I need a screen in the 5 inch range).  I narrowed down my search to the HTC One and LG G2.  I've been using the LG G2 for a few months now and besides having a faster processor there's little in their UI overlay software that gets in the way of android.  I've yet to experience app freezes and crashes.  On the galaxy s4 I'd even have problems with google maps freezing on me.  And let me tell you, the user experience on the G2 when it comes to performance is the way Android was meant to be experienced.It wasn't easy to come clean and admit that Samsung faltered on their execution as my friends would consider me a Samsung fanboy of sorts.  I love their tvs, refrigerators, washers and dryers... but the TouchWiz programming, QA, design teams need to actually start using their product along with their competition.  If it's slow.. makes things crash... then it sucks.As an aside, I went so far as to put the Galaxy S4 in developer mode and turned off the TouchWiz UI transition effects and that only provided a minor relief.  I hope that Samsung addresses the Touchwiz issues as I'd love to get back on the bandwagon, but that won't happen until they realize there even is a problem.... starting with these reviews.",4/6/14,0

183753,Downgrade from S3 to S5,Craig,R1TR4ELSDG9CKM,"I upgraded from an S3 to an S5.  I had the S3 for several years and was very happy with it.1) The day after I received my phone, I stopped receiving text messages completely.  I worked with the T-mobile rep to rectify it.  I had to do a hard reset on the phone.  Although I never received my missed texts, it seemed to work after that.  I was told that the phones were shipped with faulty software that Samsung was aware of.  Texts have worked fine since them.2) The speakerphone is a half-duplex instead of full duplex.  That means that when the other person was talking or making noise on their end, they could never hear me.  I was never sure if they were hearing what i was saying or if it was actually going through.  For example, if I was talking to someone on speakerphone who was in their car and had a lot of noise on their end, they would never hear me.  As someone who uses speakerphone a lot, this is a major problem.  My Samsung S3 was full duplex.  I never had this problem.3) My email never properly synced with my server.  If i looked at emails on my computer, they would still show as unread on my phone even AFTER I hit the sync button.  I would delete emails on my phone and after I synced, they would re-appear.4) I would choose a specific ringtone for different friends and it would only work SOMETIMES.  One time I might get the ringtone that I specified and another time I might get my generic ringtone.  No rhyme or reason.5) Because I live in NYC, some subway stations have cell service and others do not.  If I sent a text when I didn't have service, it SHOULD simply send when I got above ground or to a station that had service.  It wouldn't.  The text would just sit there and never send.  I would have to copy/paste it to a NEW text and send again.6) I used the map service to find a friend who was several blocks away.  I had an address and when I put it into the phone, it sent me in the complete wrong direction.  In fact, the map started spinning as if it had no idea how to locate where I was or where I was going.7) There was a serious lag because of Touchwiz.  It's almost as if the phone is thinking about what it needs to do.I'm being shipped a new phone but I'm not sure if it will fix ANY of these problems. If it doesn't, I'm going to have to choose a new one. Samsung REALLY rushed this one out.",5/8/14,0

Got the simm card and added the minutes. As of today her old phone still isn't activated, so nothing works. I should send it back, but I'm going to get much more satisfaction by going to Lowes and getting a bag of concrete. Incase this thing in concrete go out to the pier and drop it into Lake Michigan. This has been nothing but a pain and 30 days later no phone activation of any kind.

But iPhone, iCloud, iTunes, etc, are just a pain, there aren't enough options, it takes sometimes hours to fix a problem. I always wanted to have an iPhone, I thought to myself, Apple MUST be better, but honestly after 5 months of struggling with this device I am convinced I made the worst mistake of my life.

79247,Amazon (or Cell Surfers) sent the wrong (i.e. cheaper) card,C. Jones,R3QHFTTVB73W8S,"I chose this rating not because of the card itself but because Amazon sent the wrong card.

That wouldn't annoy me so much if the OEM version wasn't quadruple the price AND we didn't need the cards as soon as possible for an upcoming trip.So basically the old bait and switch is at play here.  I contacted Amazon customer service via chat and was told that that usually never happens--which again is not true especially since there are other reviewers who have mentioned said bait and switch.  The service rep was nice enough to help me manufacture a label so that I could take my time to run to UPS and return said incorrect items.  And then I was advised to order the cards again...in hopes that the next time around I will receive the right product.Needless to say, the product will arrive after I actually have need to put it in my new phone.

I tried to have a friend make a call from the states to deal with the region lock issue that Samsung has created but instead the guy just put in his SIM and checked his usage report, thinking that would set the phone straight. Turns out that to get a European Phone un-region locked you need to make a minumum 5 minute call from it's proper region (Europe in thins case since it is a 9005 phone). I live in India and once the phone got to me the region lock eventually caught up with me during setup, but there is a work around through some Eastern European website for 19.95 USD..... But the bigger problem was a reactivation lock. According to the stateside friend the box was open. Was this a used or grey market phone? When I started the setup process it asked me for an email and password that had been used on the phone before. I never had set this up before. I talked to the stateside service folks (no go, 9005), I talked to Indian service centers (nope, 9005), Finally I sent it to england and now it is stuck in a Geeksquad center (a contract service provider) who cant fix it, guess why.... they need the email and password! But nor will they send it to the actual Samsung repair center (who says they might be able to fix it). This phone is so trick that it's own security features has Samsung itself locked out! Is this really the first time someone has moved out of their service region, done a factory reset, and forgotten their password (which would create the same issue I have)? So is this a MyWishList issue? Only if it was not a new phone.",5/17/14,0

I only realized it on the phone when I ran out of space to install apps the first day I had it, and then called BLU support, who verified it, because it was hard to believe. Not half as much as other similar BLU phones I have encountered. Amazing because it has very few Bloatware factory unremovable apps on board.Apparently BLU engineering designated other RAM memory just for photos and the like.  Why would the do this?  Couldn't get my all my needs apps to fit!!!Other BLU phone in this price range have at least 1.0GB available - and that is also paltry, but manageable for many people for whom I set these phones up.There are  definitely other Blu phones with more memory available and on paper the specs look the same, but again:The ONLY to find out before you buy it seems to be to call BLU Support first.

This of course was after they firstly admitted that they have young staff that make mistakes and this was also after I have specifically stated that I have had my skybox company for YEARS and never had any experience with them tampering with any of my goods.Of course Cellphone Zone found it was reasonable for me to believe that my skybox company would open the box the phone came in, take out the blackberry I bought from Cellphone Zone and replace it with a faulty phone that was the exact model as the one I got for Cellphone Zone and then close back the box and somehow make it look like the seals were never broken or tampered with.

As I compare the two, note that both the iPhone 4 and 5S were running on the same carrier with the same plan.Pros:- Lots of memory- Quick processor (when it didn't lock up)- Great camera- Lightweight- The fingerprint sensor is a godsend if you need to have a strong password, and it works very wellCons:- Poor phone reception -- no phone service on the first floor of my house (my iPhone 4 gets two bars/dots and doesn't drop calls when I step in the house)- Bad 2G (Edge network) reception -- despite having a connection it can't get mail, connect to servers, etc (again, my iPhone 4 would connect in the same places without problems, albeit slowly)- Phone pauses/locks up in some apps (email and iMessage were notable since they're apps that come with the phone) and the home button needs to be pushed repeatedly to escape- The battery life is no better than my now 2+ yr old iPhone 4In the end the iPhone 5S went back because it wasn't worth taking a step backwards in cell and data coverage combined with a steep price tag.

I got this, especially if you are listening to music.  When you try to turn it back on, the entire screen goes Black.  And your only recourse is to pull off that battery, restart it again.Third, bloatware galore.  16GB of memory space, to which you you only have less <11 GB left.

86742,A scam! Beware! worst experience with a phone and seller ever,Rishel Vohnoutka,R3IMD0NKO3CTOE,"When I received this phone from the seller I first noticed the charging cord fit loosely into the micro charging port and the port had small scratches around it. I figured it was nothing major and to be expected of a used and then refurbished phone. I soon found out this minor damage was an indicator of the serious damage within the phone and that whomever refurbished the phone also destroyed the inner components. After a month of owning the phone (past the return period of the seller), the phone began to show an error while charging that said voltage too high, charging paused. This was a more serious problem, but it was past the return period of the phone so I hoped it was just an issue with the type of phone and it would still continue to function. At about 3 or 4 months of owning the phone the serious problems began to surface. First the phone began to charge less and less and would die quicker and quicker. Then the screen image started randomly jumping up and down, as very old TV's do. Next it started to randomly call people even when left on the table with nothing touching it. Then it began to type random letters when the screen was not touched and I tried to text. Finally, at about 5 months, the phone stopped charging all together and no longer functions at all. I kept the phone in a case with a screen protector the entire time I owned it and it was very gently used. I dropped it once from a low height off the ground onto a soft carpet. There are no scuff marks, no scratches, and no physical damage to the phone at all that was not already there when I purchased it (the previously mentioned marks near the charging port). The water damage indicator is not colored inside the phone and it has never been in contact with water when in my possession. There is no reason the phone should be in such poor working order that I am responsible for. This item was also listed as being in great condition and great working order, which is entirely false. It seems almost as if the seller purchases cheap phones and refurbishes them poorly then sells them knowing they will not break within the return period, but will do so shortly after purchase.I do understand that mistakes happen however and so I tried to contact the seller to get at least an explanation and maybe an apology or a discount on another phone. Instead the seller completely ignored anything I sent and closed the return/claim I made. So not only was the phone broken, but the seller did not even respond to my issues with their sale. I also looked into reviews of the seller and saw there were other people with serious issues with the items purchased. Some reviews were even positive and then changed later to reflect that the phone/item was no longer working. With that in mind, I cannot help but think I am not the only one who had a terrible transaction with this seller. I would even go as far as to hypothesize that the reason there are not more bad reviews for this seller is that people had no issues with their product initially and by the time it broke it was past the return period and they were to disgruntled to take the time to change their review or did not know how to.I feel as if this seller is a scam and you, the buyer, should avoid purchases from this seller. Unless you are okay wasting your money on a phone that breaks in less than half a year and then your concerned are ignored by the seller.",5/10/14,0

55005,iPhone 4 NOT NEW as claimed by seller Trans Tech Products and listed under Amazon Prime,LocalRevolution,R3U1RFVXUCZ6KA,"First off, I have had one of these models for a couple years. I love the quality of my iPhone 4 but hate being under contact, which is why I wanted to get the same phone for my two daughters but without the 2 year obligation. Verizon is doing a $25 per line discount on non-contract smartphones right now too. It is a great deal that can pay for an outright device purchase quickly unless you wind up using a lot of data.This review is not for the iPhone 4, but for the seller I dealt with through Amazon Prime, and for Amazon itself.The purchase I made was entirely misrepresented. Neither of these iPhone 4s were new as claimed by Trans Tech Products & sold as new by Amazon Prime.Both iPhones purchased looked pretty good cosmetically and had a clean MEID that could be activated through Verizon without problems, but both serial numbers had previous Apple registration & expired warranties. There was non-standard packaging on both phones (incl. replaced back and front scratch protector stickers with hair and dust stuck under them, carefully lifted but tampered external box seals and info tags, replaced wrappers and twist ties on wires, and a metal SIM insert holder in the rather dogeared welcome material enclosure, on a SIM-free Verizon CDMA phone). Both phones were missing the standard dot moisture sensors in headphone jacks and plug, which my local MacXpert said meant the phones had almost assuredly been opened, either for service or part replacement. Their absence would usually void any warranty on the phone. Although wiped of personal information, each phone had an updated operating system and many applications open when I powered them on. They immediately displayed the lock screen instead of the set-up assistant wizard. Clearly they were pre-owned.I am not adverse to buying a refurbished or well cared-for used device at a decent price, but I paid Trans Tech Products a premium for these iPhones based on the New claim, thinking I would also get the manufacturer's warranty. When I contacted Amazon about this issue, I indicated a willingness to keep the devices at a fair used price. They immediately agreed to refund to me the difference between what I had paid initially and what a used iPhone 4 is now selling for on Amazon, about half the nearly $200 New list price charged by Trans Tech Products.This sort of dishonest and misleading listing made under the umbrella of Amazon Prime really damages the trust of the consumer, regardless of whether Amazon is almost always willing to make it right through return and refund or not. This corporate honesty unfairly depends on the critical attention and a high degree of product knowledge on the part of the purchaser. If I buy something claimed as NEW and sold by such an established retailer as Amazon, I should be able to trust that it will delivered as 100% new in every aspect without exception. Amazon needs to do a more careful job of vetting their sellers, especially the ones they allow to sell under the Amazon Prime listing.",5/18/14,0

The WiFi is terrible, my new LG Optimus II is way better at connecting and staying connected. You have to be a very short distance from a hotspot to get a signal. The performance is also lousy with daily lock-ups. The LG Optimus II I have now has the same processor, so it must be the firmware that is the issue. I also found some apps did not run on this phone, like my banks app (Associated Bank).Another issue is the cheap screen, which looked OK in portrait, but had issues when turned sideways to view a video. The blacks would look silver and the contrast was very bad in landscape mode.I had the phone close to 30 days before returning it.",5/21/14,0

45150,What a great disappointment,HN Ezuoke Ugochukwu,R1K9HUNSF61BP1,"This phone to me is the worst phone i have ever used, i three of this phone in two weeks, i first bought the Dell venue which i noticed cannot work without sd card, when i make a call nobody hears my voice only when someone calls me that they can hear my voice, so i resorted to using bluetooth without which i cannot make a call. I requested to change it and but Dell streak, i bought it being that the condition stated new and should include all the accessories only for me to open it and lo it was used with no single accessory, has 0% battery life, i plugged it to power source to see if it will charge, for one hour the battery life still remains 0%. i returned the phone same day i received it, and requested to have it changed, amazon suggested a different buyer i did bought the phone it was shipped under one day delivery as amazon waived the fee for me. When i received the phone the following day, i opened it and it was same thing as the previous buyer, no accessories but has like 60% battery life, i complained to amazon and they ask me to return it and even refunded the money, i took the phone home with hope if it remains good i will forget about the accessories, but to my disappointment, it was same thing as Dell Venue and even worst, phone cannot function without SD card, i make call nobody hears me. My little advice to buyers is before buying read my post and if you can handle this, (should it occur to you) then go ahead, if not dont waste your money on Dell phone, they need more work on their phone before selling it to consumers.",5/30/14,0

When I talked to samsung see if there's a solution, they simplely refused to help as well as not offering a refund which is with-in the purchase return policy. There's simply no warrning sign or any notice on the box or through any form of education indicated google apps/serices cannot be installed. And the fact is my life and business depends on goolge apps/services. I simply bought a smart phone which has the smart tooken away and non even Google or Samsung or the carrier willling to help.

169466,Anger taking over,Sophia Veritas,R2RW3V2Z9N0M6C,"I am so angry.  This phone is advertised as a tracfone that uses minutes.  As a matter of fact the whole reason I purchased it was because it advertises triple minutes.  However, according to the box it is a net 10 wireless.  So I purchased a net 10 wireless card, try to add the minutes, and lo and behold, it doesnt work.  i call the company and spend an hour trying to nderstand someone who does not understand me, only to be told that it is not net 10' it is tracfone.  The tracfone cards will not work on it, but the fine print finally tells me that it will take a monthy net 10 card of 50 dollars.  So now i have wasted money on the phone and on a scratched off card I cannot return, and I am furious with tracfone, net 10' and amazon.com for selling this under false advertising, and I never want to do businees with any of them again.

158926,This is a great phone,Chel in,R2VGKXGY2CWI5F,"I was on the fence between the 5C and 5S and I went for the 5C. The reason was because of the color and because I am a little hard on phones so I felt the build was more rugged.The 5C is not selling well and it is certainly not a cheap phone. I know the S model has a little bit more power on the camera and the different chip but the 5C meets my needs well.  Note - there are some packages on Cydia that you can download to give it the same functionality as the 5S. I'm on T-Mobile and Internet on LTE is blazingly fast, video calling works great and email and calendars are top notch. I was using a 3GS for a few years as a backup phone to my BlackBerry and now the BB is the backup. If you JB your phone, you can do a lot with it.Note - I did get a bad phone first time around - the phone and charger were way hot. Since I bought it locally I was able to exchange it within 14 days and got a new one and all is well.I am surprised at some of the bad reviews but it looks like it has to do with the sellers.PS I ordered white not blueIf you are in the US and are going to pay full price for the phone, go to Apple or your local carrier.",1/9/14,1

Contrary to other reviews, the phone is indeed unlocked, and it works perfectly with a new nano SIM card. Just make sure that you double check the specific seller you're buying it from, read their reviews, and then make sure the order is fulfilled by Amazon to have an extra amount of certainty. I suppose some sellers have mistakenly sent locked phones, that's why you have to do the homework and check them individually.",1/31/14,1

177813,Cheapest TMO LTE Phone,Farmer Ted,R3FBDYKGQ22TD7,"For the features (quad-core, decent camera, 4G LTE in most cities, etc.), this is a great smartphone. No updates to OS when I received it (1/2014), so still at Android 4.2.2. Introduces Blocking mode, where it allows 'quiet time', like you see in Cyanogen mod OSes. The screen has really minor backlight bleeding on the top, but the screen is bright and looks really good, almost IPS quality (I hear it is TN) -- really, the screen looks good.So, for the price, you do get crappy resolution and is not as girthy as the more expensive Galaxy smartphones. But, amazingly, the screen looks really good.WiFi calling and ability to accept 64GB microSD card rounds-out the features.Looking for a cheap, fast, and 4G LTE smartphone? This is the one to get.",1/28/14,1

176187,Best bang for the buck,kevin fanning,RS3TVC7CB5GPO,"The Moto G is the best bang for the buck. The only downside to this phone is lack of LTE, but I knew this before buying it. I would definitely recommend buying this phone.If more people bought unlocked phones like this and used prepaid plans they could cut their monthly cellular bills in half and hopefully change the way carriers(with their excessive fees and charges) do business.I don't know if most people know that their supposedly free phones are costing them hundreds of dollars with their two year contracts.",1/11/14,1

155676,Done with Internet Costs $$$,B. Speer,R1JIN8OOGH9VYA,"Many years ago started with straight cell phone and loved everything about it.  Then went for the good life with Internet.Already had a 28 desk top screen, then added the 9 tablet, and a 17 laptop.  That cell phone screen was so small usage was limited.  Always went for the tablet or desk top with their bigger screens and much faster navigation.  Even with a stylus the phone was a hassle.My two yrs went by plus two more.  Finally I asked myself why am I paying $2650 for each two yrs contract?  After looking at what was popular found the Convoy.  It was so successful it's 3rd version was now offered.  Still wondering about $10 or $20 a month for texting??  Maybe just pay .20ea text?  Often when I send a text to friends I still call them to work out details and misunderstandings.  Plus calling seems so much more personal even with clients. Been studying the Internet Convoy 3 manual couple days now.  Pretty straight forward and I like it's simplicity and saving about $50/mon on our two phones.  $600/yr matters to us and I still prefer the desk top 28 or sometimes the 9 tablet.Another plus for my wife and I is how clear the voice is on the Convoy.  Way better than the Samsung Galaxy ever was.  Convoy is built tough so no cases or pouches or screen savers.  Dropping it a few times seems to be ok according to users??Four years and $1200 wasted on Iphones.  Some do lots of business on them and good for them.  I draw CAD and 28 is best for that with 5 to 8 million key strokes per project!  Two Convoy 3s total $36.02 all tax except .02, LOLHappy Trails",1/16/14,1
133965,My Sony Xperia E C1504,Frances Thorne,R2LHKQUX8FBRG5,"I wanted to become familiar with my phone before I wrote a review. I have used it for almost a month now. I am not 100% familiar with it, but so far it is a great little phone. I wanted a simple phone with out a lot of hassle. This phone is easy to use. The light weight and shape make it comfortable to hold. The screen is smaller than some other phones. My screen  is only a little shorter than my husband's iphone 5. In all I am very satisfied with my Sony Xperia E C1504 and Xperia may be my phone of choice for future purchases!",1/25/14,1

167821,Incredibly good phone and amazing deal,Bill Aggie dcman,R1EQ9C7USS4TL0,"May 5, 2014.  Okay, just wanted to update my latest success with this phone.  The phone is Awesome!  It runs everything thrown at it and I've not yet found any app on Google that says incompatiable.  I'm thrilled to report that Google Chromecast works flawless on this.  I don't know why anybody would want any other phone.  If you are in the 50 and older crowd, you will appreciate the clear bright and LARGE screen.  It's the ideal size for accomplishing almost anything and this is the phone you can actually see well enough to do some web browsing, emailing and more.  I have not hat one single glitch on both my wifes and my own phone.  Buy it!April 14th 2014 Update, bought a 2nd one.  This is for my wife and is using an AT@T unlimited reseller plan.  She's got unlimited talk, text and 1/2 gig of web.  My facebook crazy wife never uses more than about 400mb per month so she's good on the unlimited AT@T plan.  We're paying $27.00 per month ...  beats all deals!Phones, have been dropped, rained on,  and once accidentially left on my dash and was hotter than you could hold from the heat of the sun. Was sure the phone would have fried or at least been non-operational from the 140+ degrees heat from that sun on the dash.. Phone worked flawless.  Must have a monster heat sink desgin on the cpu or it's just a well balanced phone!  Again, get it, you won't regret it!  Also.... a comment about videos being pixelated from youtube.  That's not likely an issue with the phone.  Bandwitch limits might pixelate the stream, the phone is solid.UPDATE:  See original review below:This just keeps getting better for me.  FYI,  framaroot 1.9.1 will gain root for this device on the first try.  My blu studio 5.5 is running like a champ and with root access I can run an amazing number of vital apps like Android Lost, and others, that let you track your phone when lost or even zero out the data if lost for good.  Root access is amazing in what your android can do!Folks,  I've seen mostly positive reviews and a few critical reviews on this phone.  I am not sure where the critical reviews come from.  I consider this a near flawless implementation of a huge 5.5 clear bright screen.  If you are a ordinary cell user like myself,  you will not find any limits in this phones capacity.  Maybe it performs slightly slower per some other tests that were run but unless you are in some kind of highly intense application that is not typical for a phone, you will not notice any speed issues.  I see none in my ordinary use for texting, google voice, email, phone calls, etc.  This phone is awesome!  It is the best deal and the best phone I've ever ordered.  We have it connected to Tmobile using a third party carrier and I get full web and data access for $10.00 per 2 months on a pay as you go plan.  On the Tmobile third party carrier I use,  $10.00 buys me 200 anytime minutes or 599 Texts or 100 MBytes of data, and you have up to 2 months to use the $10.00.  You can auto recharge ever time the $10.00 is used up.  My cost is averaging about $5.00 per month allowing this phone's WIFI to take over for free calls and data when wifi is near.  This is an incredible smart phone and can be used in an incredibly inexpensive way.  To get the free WIFI calls, you'll need to install Google Voice from Play.google and of course set up a Google Voice phone number.  Configure the settings in Google Voice then turn off your DATA from your carrier to test the app to use WIFI only to place and receive calls.  These calls on WIFI are off your minute plan.  They are free on WIFI.  Same with Google Text.  This is how I get my service for about $5.00 per month on a SmartPhone.Additional info contained in comments for this reviewAlso, I should mention that you may have to manually add your APN after inserting your SIM card.  The SIM card will give you voice and text, but data may not work until you select your carrier in the setup menu.  In my case, I had to enter the APN info for my Tmobile reseller.Update:  You may want to get this case from AMAZON while you order.  It's a really nice protective case.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HVV9I9K/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0",1/18/14,1

I'm still learning how to use some of the new features like the twist and open camera feature and a few other things.  I was amazed how fast netflix opened, loaded and started playing a movie.  The picture was incredibly sharp and clear.  The only downside so far is that my calls are no clearer than the ones on my previous phone.  This phone beats the Samsung Fascinate hands-down and I even think it's nicer than my wife's Galaxy S III.  And lastly, I'd like to mention that the battery life is exceptional.  I almost bought the Droid Maxx because of its advertised battery life and I'm glad I didn't.  I'm very happy with my choice so far.",1/14/14,1

174213,Affordable but not cheap,Evangel Biason,R3N59EK8AKO3J0,"For the budget conscious, the Moto G delivers an affordable smartphone that performs. It's quadcore Snapdragon processor delivers enough power to motor through day to day applications. It also delivers a very pure android KitKat experience by stripping out the flashy features that may be impractical for daily use and focuses on features that matter such as a amazing battery life and a sharp 4.5 1280 x 720 HD display.It does have its limitations, namely it's 5MP camera that is quite mediocre in contrast to the phone's other hardware specs. It aslo lacks the microSD expansion slot, but again for day to day use, the 16GB version suffices. Google is also offering 50GB of Google Drive space for Moto G owners who need more than the stock internal memory.Moto G also feels comfortable to hold. Minus the overly protruding volume and power buttons, the phone is quite sleek with clean lines.Bottom line, the Moto G blows away all the smartphones in it's price range and would even challenge phones twice its price.",1/2/14,1

It can do anything a much more expensive Android phone can do but at a much lower price and with no string attached. We put in the Micro SD card and increased the capacity to 36 GB, which is adequate. The only issue I want to raise is the 8 megapixels camera. The pictures taken are not that sharp, expecially indoors or under cloudy skies. But with this price, it is understandable.",1/4/14,1
155768,Great Phone!,brett a. daniel,R30I4QRJCX8DYE,"I upgraded to the moto x from Galaxy S3. The very first thing I noticed with this phone is the battery life. I frequently forget to turn off my wifi when leaving for work in the morning. Since there is no wifi at work, my S3 would be around 35-40% battery left upon getting home. That's over the course of 9 hours. With my new moto, I don't even bother turning it off. My battery has about 85% left when i get home. The screen looks good and apps run smoothly. Running the 8 cores seperately really seems to make this phone very efficient. Touchless controls work way better than i was expecting. I thought the double twist instant on camera  would be a minor feature for this phone. Now that I have it, I don't think I would want to go without it. I highly Recommend this phone!",1/14/14,1

133035,Taking The One To The Max! #HTCOnemax Cell Phone,GoodNCrazy Carissa Rogers,R1CXRU6RQZOTN3,"First letâ€™s talk about size, is this phone too big is the first question people ask me? Iâ€™m a busy mom of 3 kids and often I use my phone more like my laptop. 5.9 inches of  screen real estate simply makes every task easier. Taking Photos, editing for Instagram, keeping tabs on my daughterâ€™s social media, reading ebooks, GPS navigation, recipe research in the grocery storeâ€_ oh yeah and talking/texting!You must use two fists to use this phone. I do stress about dropping it due to itâ€™s size. But it fits in my back pocket and in my small shoulder purse. I was used to both the HTC One (4.7â€ù) and the HTC DNA (5â€ù) so I was already past using both thumbs to type.The answer?  I love the size of this phone. Watching people with MUCH smaller phones (Iâ€™m looking at you iPhone) makes me smile a little bit as I pull out my phone!The HTCOnemax comes with the upgraded HTC Sense 5.5 and there are several new features worth noting: The HTC Scribble App is new and one of the best note-taking, list-making, doodling and journaling apps Iâ€™ve ever seen (and Iâ€™ve tried a LOT). The TV Remote app is simply terrific. Even if you donâ€™t use it as a remote, it has an amazingly functional program guide. No more searching for programs for hours on your awful TV/Cable guide! Plus added features like a fingerprint unlock scan, faster access to the most used settings and upgrades to the HTC Blinkfeed (option to turn it off and can now add your fave blog RSS feedsâ€”love that!).Read my Full Review of new HTC Sense 5.5 on my blog.[...]Are you more about using your phone for all your entertainment needs?Now you can take it to the MAX! Iâ€™ve been catching up on Netflix Original Seriesâ€™ like Derek and Black is the New Orange. Watching on the Maxâ€™s large screen with HD quality is perfect when Iâ€™m waiting to pick up kids or while jogging on the treadmill! I now ONLY use my cell phone as my main eReader. Even the 5â€ù screens Iâ€™ve used before were just too small for real reading compared to the Max.Iâ€™m all about cameras on cell phones.Theyâ€™ve gotten so advanced I rarely use my big girl camera any more. The Max is no different. It has a 4MP UltraPixel rear camera and 2.1-megapixel front-facing camera. (Love the swipe across the screen to change to front facing camera.) The front-facing camera has a wide angle large enough to fit my whole family in a â€˜Selfieâ€™ shot! And the HTC photo gallery now offers highlight videos, creating automatic mini videos from stills, Zoes and video youâ€™ve taken at a particular event. You look like a professional with filters and music built in!And the final Maxed up treatâ€_The battery length, even with the huge screen, is longer than any phone Iâ€™ve ever tested. With my constant mom-use I find the phone lasts around 26 or 28 hours. But with the HTC Power Flip Case with battery extender the Max routinely runs for 36 hours and longer! That is a GoodNCrazy long time!Please NOTE: I was given the #HTCOnemax to test out on an extended loan at no cost to me. My thoughts and opinions are my own. I am an Android fan.",1/28/14,1
111020,Awesome!,Joshua Block,R1CG7IOK28KTSM,"Excellent! I bought the refurbished product and straight out of the box it was basically brand new. No scratches or dings at all. Also has great form factor and super lightweight. Works great with iOS 7 and it has great battery life! Typically lasts about 1.5 - 1.75 days with moderate use. I frequently use it during the day to access apps for work and review emails and texts. I don't spend too much time talking on the phone during the work day, though. What made me switch back to iOS after having my galaxy s3 was the ability to backup apps and more importantly all of the app data to the cloud. It automatically backs up at the end of the day when I plug it in at bedtime because I leave my Bluetooth and wi-if on 24/7. Don't think I'll ever go back to android again.",1/24/14,1
170611,"Amazing, just amazing",sandeep reddy,R1E7JMK3ELOZDK,"For it's price even the camera is fine.It has no NFC, no LTE, no wireless charging, no wired charger neither (came with only a data cable), no earphones. But that's all okay. As soon as I switched it on and I saw the Motorola Logo on screen, I could see it was just as good as an iPhone's display; IPS LCD 329 PPI (higher than the iPhone)As it booted up, it immediately upgraded to Android KitKat 4.2.2.There is NOTHING wrong with this device for it's price. For $199, it will challenge even the $450 to $500 ranged phones available now, off contract. Go for it.",1/3/14,1

31898,Phone Looks Good....As A Paperweight - Updated To 5 Stars,A. Tucker,R369CTC5500M44,"I'll update my rating as soon as I actually get to use the phone.  Unlike some other reviewers who received an adapter with their European charger, I guess I didn't rate one and have no way to charge the phone currently.  The manuals I received are for Central Europe/Balkans...Serbia, Bosnia, etc.  No big deal, I found the English manual on the Samsung site.  It would have been nice to get going out of the box but I expected some potholes with an offshore phone.  More later.Updated 2/2/2014I'm changing my review to 5 stars.  After purchasing a U.S. charger (Part #ATADS10JBE) and a Samsung data cable, I was able to get this phone prepped for my dad.  He's essentially a phone only guy and didn't want anything beyond the ability to make phone calls and use a bluetooth headset due to a new state law requiring hands-free operation.  The flip phone he had, via AT&T;, did not have bluetooth and he did not want to get a phone through them that would force him to extend his contract.  When I got this phone fully charged I was able to pair it up with his bluetooth headset (plantronics) with no problems.  We popped in his SIM card from his old phone and he was up and running in 3 minutes.  This is a great little phone and as soon as his contract is up, he can jump on a pay as you go plan and save a ton of money.  After he's had it for a while, I'll try and update this review again.",1/10/14,1

84320,Amazon Warehouse deal is great!,Barbara,RYC9ZP82GFGE8,"I am not going to review the iPhone 4S--there are millions of reviews out there and I can't add anything.  I love the phone.  I ordered the iPhone 4S 64 GB (Black) Verizon version from Amazon Warehouse deals.  It was described as Like New.  It WAS new, in a shrink wrapped Apple box, with all accessories in the box as well.  I was able to switch it with my old Samsung Stratosphere, which had a grandfathered unlimited data plan, online at the Verizon website, with no problems.  I was able to keep my data plan.  I have had the phone for a day now and it is great!!  Thank you Amazon Warehouse Deals!!",1/16/14,1
83740,GREAT PHONE!!!!,barbie,R35B4WNT2KGAM4,"I order this phone and received it in the mail in two days. The shipping was super fast! I was able to get my phone turned on at Verizon and so far everything has been working properly. I do not have, nor had  any problems since I bought this phone.

148810,Amazing phone,Kat8nine,R3LDTBP5J2ACJA,I bought this phone because my previous phone was not functioning properly and because I wanted a change. This phone works so smoothly and it's a really fun phone to use. It fits in your hand pretty well and it's an intuitive operating system. I would recommend this phone to friends.,1/5/14,1
145141,Fantastic Value,tomicamp79,R20I8NLJ5X80N6,"Received my phone about 2 weeks ago.  I'm using this with Net10 (AT&T;) and couldn't be happier.  I have been searching for the perfect phone and carrier and finally found them.  The BLU Life Play has a crystal clear display, is extremely fast, and is as thin as a pencil!  The battery life is average (I wish it was better) however it takes a full charge in about 45 - 60 minutes so I can live with it.  I would recommend this phone - next best thing to a Samsung Galaxy at a third of the price!!! Buy it - you will be glad you did!!!",1/6/14,1

161938,Future of the Android?,T. M. Tikhomirov kalistrat,R1B2EZRHBT2L1G,"I received my phone a few days ago and have been tweaking and setting it up to run the way I like it. First impression - I have a guilty feeling - because I want other people to see this phone and think: What is this? I took it to T-mobile store to get a new sim card, and the shop personnel gathered to look it it.I must admit that I have been a relatively dedicated customer of Sony. My previous phone was Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc. I really enjoyed using it everywhere I went: Europe, Latin America and here in the U.S. I used it with a pretty extensive number of mobile service providers, and it always worked great for me. But, the standards have changed and it seemed like a good time to start taking advantage of 4G LTE, faster processors and larger memory capacity. All of it really make no difference for a regular phone user. But, if you stay connected for business or recreational purposes you want all the high standards to be there. BTW, the main reason I wanted a large phone was because I am using it now more frequently than a laptop.Having said this, I need to add that I am not a heavy phone user, and my family plan is only 1000 shared minutes that we never use up between my better half and kid. Nevertheless, there is a number of android apps that allow me to stay current with all my e-mail, documents, messages, conversions and calculations that I find myself using more and more heavily, especially when I travel.This phone is beautiful and very convenient as a phone because it's very thin and relatively light. But, functionality-wise it can compete with any tablet PC. As a result, you have best of the two worlds.After using the phone for just 3 days I have been very impressed with it's smooth performance, high download speeds, easy, logical and highly customizable settings. Everything seems to work as it is intended by the company I can trust.The only thing I am not sure about is the phone's resistance to shock. I found myself handling it with extra caution. However, I am sure I will find out soon enough, especially when I go on my next international trip.",1/8/14,1
70195,Good product,Cynthia Pearl,R3182UG3IW579R,I like this particular model of the Samsung Intensity phone.  I have an Intensity 3 and do not like it as well as the 2.  Have not had any issues with the buttons.  Works well.  Would recommend this phone for a non data phone.  My son has this phone and I am thinking about purchasing another one for myself.,1/5/14,1
14088,Samsun T301G Prepaid Phone (Tracfone),K. Zander,R1IOPFKUHO57NA,"I have had a couple of these phones for years. I had one and my husband had one. My husband's finally died after about 2 years so I wanted to replace it with one like we had. It worked right out of the box and we are happy with it. It is a no frills phone, but it does what we want it to do. I would recommend this product. The price is great, too!",1/17/14,1
161880,Greatest purchase I ever made.,julio lonnie lopez,RDAV16X6AKQMF,"First of all, I got this phone fast in the mail and it was real easy to set up. I have ATT with a data plan already and have been out of contract for the past 2 months.  My plan was to never get back into contract again with anyone so I bought this phone, hoping it would fulfill my dream of freedom.  And it has in spades.  The phone is great, snappy fast, and worked with my SIM card and my plan without having to change anything, except for ATT charging a $1 fee for changing phones, sneaky.This phone is a gateway phone, hopefully it will teach the American consumer that you don't need to have a subsidized phone in order to have a good.  That you don't need to be locked into a contract or a company for that matter.  Freedom!",1/7/14,1
11071,Great phone,MisMilliss,R3IQAUPNRSCSOY,"Got this for my daughter and it works great. It's not a smart phone but she loves the touch capability and I like not having outrageous data fees.Overall, it's a great LG phone at a great price!",1/7/14,1

Only issue is that the case he bought doesn't allow for use of one of the side buttons so he is not using a protective case. The phone was a good value on Amazon and I'd recommend the phone and this seller.,1/25/14,1

90006,2 thumbs UP!!!,Service member,R2ZZ0IAQXJ0FFC,This is a great product for the price asking for by this company. I have ordered several for my employees because they just love it for work and does everything we need to do as a company and in the field.This company has exceed my expectations concerning this product. Sometimes new phones is not the best solution. Invest your money in company's like this one who offer a quality product even if it's refurbished.,1/9/14,1
151751,Really good for price,Sarah Donley,R1N8EUAXEFF302,For $100 this is a good phone because you get full access to the windows store.

171868,Love this phone so far.,Jim Nelson,R2X0PIUYX5Z06,"I basically got this phone for $50 of my own money due to some holiday amazon gift cards, and I really like it. The last smart phone I had was an original razr so it is not a huge jump up to something like the nexus 5, s4, or g2, but for the price the phone is great. It has handled everything i've done with it so far.My only issue is coming from an incredibly expensive but also incredibly stable and reliable Verizon contract, to a really cheap(and bad) t-mobile prepaid plan, there has been alot to be left desired. But what is good is that I have the flexibility to shop around and try out a few plans with an unlocked phone.The colors are bright. I'm used to kitkat because I have a nexus 7 2013, so the Moto G feels right at home.My only negatives about the phone are that the black backing is really gunked up with fingerprints. I bought a cyan backing though so I don't think that will be an issue when that gets here. Also dust particles seem to get lodged in between the screen and bezel which I'm not too fond of.",1/23/14,1
152841,That is the big phone other than Galaxy S4 I want,Chengduwa,R2BWS6QFWERJBW,"I had a Iphone4 and I wanted to change to an Android phone with a big screen. After investigation, HTC one and Samsung Galaxy S4 are the two choices. I don't like the appearance of S4 personally especially its plastic case. In comparison, HTC one is really beautiful and elegant. Screen display is very sharp and bright. 32g internal memory is as twice as Iphone and S4, so I never worry about storage as I used to be using Iphone. By the way, it is easy to use. One thing I noticed is that HTC one Wifi is not as stable as Iphone when you switch from 4G to Wifi or from one Wifi to another Wifi. It takes several seconds to get to good signal.",1/14/14,1

171846,Great Android Phone,John,RKYKQU3SU8017,This is a very nice phone. The screen is easy to read and the phone performs flawlessly. My only negative is the lack for a memory card slot. I got the 16gb model so the lack of a memory card should not be a problem.,1/27/14,1

159422,"Im not a apple head, i love android but..",Chidinma,R2OY0GYDVMLBGK,"I was a little skeptical at first about buying this phone from amazon because i got it at the price $499 (brand new!! Sealed) but i couldn't be happier! The phone of course is running ios 7 straight from the box and the touch i.d is probably the best thing ever. If you're debating whether to get the 5c or 5s definitely spend a little more for the 5s its totally worth it. The camera is great. Extremely fast and extremely clear. There are new options on it like the slomo effect which is fun to play with. The dual tone flash takes mobile picture taking to a whole other level. The best camera on a phone in the market. Take that from someone who has had a galaxy note 2 and samsung galaxy s3. The screen size is something people might not want to over look. If you have extremely big hands i would say go in store and try it out, see how well you can operate it. But its definitely one handable meaning you can use it with only one hand and not ever have to over stretch. The resolution is crystal clear, no doubt about that. Although the phone is 1.2 ghz it is blazing fast. It is a 64 bit. I can play heavy games like GTA and not ever freeze on me, even with lots of apps running in the background. Battery life is as expected when dealing with apple. But one thing i have noticed standby times are incredibly great. I can go to sleep with my phone at 100% and wake up and its at 99% sometimes still 100%. This phone is not droppable you'll have lucky moments when you drop it and it doesn't shatter but if it falls too high and too hard or at the wrong angle, your screen will be gone. Though I've had mine for over a month I haven't cracked it because i always keep it in a case. So invest in something protective like a speck case or otterbox or some generics.",1/31/14,1

The Windows 8 system is speedy and easy to use, although the lack of popular apps such as Candy Crush and no flash player available is sort of disappointing. (But that's the OS system and not the phone.) I absolutely love the fact that I just had to cut up my SIM card from my old flippy phone, and the phone still works perfectly.

177126,I LOVE this phone!,bikerbaz,RT73HN79PH6TB,"I couldn't be more pleased with the moto g! I appreciate that it is not a 'flagship' phone--which, of course, is reflected in the price. If you must have the most powerful phone, then of course you have to pay for it. I was attracted to the idea of a 'pure Android' phone with updates as soon as they come available, and I was considering the Nexus 5. But I decided in the end that, for my use, it was really more phone than I needed. After researching the moto g, I decided it was just what I was looking for--and 3 weeks of use tells me I made the right choice!A little context--since one's user-experience of a phone is a relative thing. I was replacing a very antiquated phone, my first smartphone in fact--an LG Optimus V, circa 2011! (Clearly, I'm not a must-have-the-latest-gadget user.) The moto g is light-years ahead of what I'm used to, so it doesn't matter to me that I could spend 3 times as much and have an even faster processor, even sharper screen, or whatever. I'm amazed and thrilled that I can get this great phone for 200 bucks! The size is perfect (I find the Nexus 5 a little large), the screen is brilliant, the speed and smoothness of operation are great--even the camera, which I know is far from the best available, is a big improvement over my old phone. LTE is very limited in my area, so not having it is no real loss for me; and the greater power of the phone, over what I'm used to, makes 3G feel so much faster! And anyway, most of my day-to-day use is within reach of wifi.If you're looking for a new phone, you probably know what kind of user you are, how much of a premium you place on having the highest possible specs, or whatever. The moto g perfectly fills just the niche I was looking for!Btw, if you decide on the moto g and are looking for a minimalist sort of case, the Ringke Slim is really nice!",1/20/14,1

151693,Great non-murderous device.,Anonymous,R36XZ1QUM4GMR0,"For the price you can't really beat this phone. I've used android phones which on paper should be better than this and they can't compare to the usability that i've gotten from this phone. There's very few apps that I used on Android that aren't available on windows phone and i think the ones that are on windows phone just look nicer albeit thats more of a personal opinion sort of thing i guess. The phone is very easy to use although it does not have the same amount of customizability that you may come to expect after using an android phone but instead will probably be more comparable to an iPhone (at least based on my experience) the nice thing about this though is that everything just seems to work better together. The camera is pretty good albeit i'm sure flagship phones would do better. It performed better than my HTC G2 though which was what I was aiming for so i'm pretty satisfied. It has a good build quality and i've dropped it a few times without it exploding which is a plus. In addition it has yet gain sentience and try to kill me in my sleep...yet. Overall though it's a great phone, it may not compare to a flagship device with super fancy specs but it performs surprising well given the hardware, and honestly i feel like it comes pretty close.",1/23/14,1

160842,iPhone 5s: state of the art and hard to fault,The Guardian,R3KWG6J16N8H5D,"In the past 4 years I have owned Android and (the now virtually redundant) Blackberry phones prior to buying an iPhone 5s in early December 2013. Overall I prefer the iPhone over the others and would recommend it, with a few minor reservations.The iPhone 5s is superior in these areas:1. The design is a work of art, finely sculpted and proportioned; a pleasure to hold and use2. The screen is fantastic; big enough to be really useful but small enough for the phone to be easily pocketable. The Blackberry screen was maybe too small for most applications except for email, and the Android too big and heavy for portable use. I particularly like the long narrow screen on the 5s3. A lot of thought has gone into the way a user can navigate around the screen through the different functions. I have owned an iPod Touch for a couple of years and have become a fan of Apple's clear and simple graphics: on the 5s, it's even better. The software never crashes, which it did with both my Android phones frequently4. For a user with larger than average hands/fingers, the on-screen keypad of the 5s is really well designed - especially true if you use the phone in landscape format which has the effect of widening the keypad. In comparison, the Android was frustrating and not very user-friendly and the Blackberry Storm completely hopeless - though the permanent keypad on the Curve was great5. The ring tone & speaker volume is louder and clearer on the iPhone than any of its rivals6. Phone reception is the best. I don't know how Apple manage this, but I have made and received calls in locations where other phones don't seem to work  - like travelling on the London underground and in deep underground car parks7. The camera is so good it's up to the standard of a dedicated Canon or Nikon compact, for the first time on a cellphone8. The memory (64GB) is vast, with a storage capacity so huge you're never likely to need more no matter what you download and store on it9. Siri, iMessage and Facetime are genuinely useful apps, not just gimmicks. They actually work well. The fingerprint scanner works too, though how much of a real security feature this is remains doubtfulGripes: very few -1. The battery life isn't great, but no worse than the Android Galaxy 4 and you can substantially improve it on the 5s by turning off power-hungry applications2. The unique nano-SIM means you can't swap the SIM over to another phone in an emergency, or for example if the phone is damaged and needs repair3. The price of the 5s is a bit steep, but here you really do get what you pay forOverall I have become a reluctant Apple convert. It's easy to see why they have become market leader with such an excellent product. Of course in another 2 or 3 years the tech will have moved on again, there may be a new market-leading manufacturer and the 5s will be an antique. But until then, the 5s for me is the King of cellphones.Finally, a lot of one-star reviews posted on amazon are from buyers griping about having been shipped locked phones by online sellers. This must be very frustrating but these are not really product reviews, they are complaints about the seller. The solution is easy: buy from an Apple store and they'll set up the new iPhone for you and transfer all the data from your old phone.",1/15/14,1
90550,Samsung Purchase.,les,R2I8I6UUWFEE5V,I bought this product for a friend abroad and he was totally impressed.

On behalf of my friend- this phone & Seller are the real Deal.,1/4/14,1
173521,Love this phone so far.,Jim Nelson,R2X0PIUYX5Z06,"I basically got this phone for $50 of my own money due to some holiday amazon gift cards, and I really like it. The last smart phone I had was an original razr so it is not a huge jump up to something like the nexus 5, s4, or g2, but for the price the phone is great. It has handled everything i've done with it so far.My only issue is coming from an incredibly expensive but also incredibly stable and reliable Verizon contract, to a really cheap(and bad) t-mobile prepaid plan, there has been alot to be left desired. But what is good is that I have the flexibility to shop around and try out a few plans with an unlocked phone.The colors are bright. I'm used to kitkat because I have a nexus 7 2013, so the Moto G feels right at home.My only negatives about the phone are that the black backing is really gunked up with fingerprints. I bought a cyan backing though so I don't think that will be an issue when that gets here. Also dust particles seem to get lodged in between the screen and bezel which I'm not too fond of.",1/23/14,1
180809,nice phone,jeremy delong,R2YOZG964401G9,Great phone at a good price. Wish i would have got a Samsung phone awhile ago.

166208,Perfect for what I need...,Peter G.,RCEPGQREJ3DSB,"I needed a phone while traveling overseas. This thing is absolutely perfect. $29 shipped, are you kidding?Takes pictures, has a rather good FM radio, holds the charge fantastic, and most importantly it's a telephone. Takes two sims and a memory card. Yes, it isn't a $800 smart phone, but I wouldn't cry for it if I lost it or got pickpocketed. BLU nailed this one. For $29 it's an easy 5 stars.",1/9/14,1
179240,Love the phone so far!,Cat lover Marcia,R3K7PIDB1OB7Q6,So far I love this prepaid phone. I'm not using it for email since I prefer not to have another email account. My computer and iPad are both Apple products and I use them for email. I bought the phone at Best Buy and the salesman transferred everything from my old Verizon non-smartphone. The online manual had been very helpful since it's my first android phone. Just a word of warning. I bought a grip shell from Motorola because the phone is somewhat slippery. Several websites tell you to take off the back of the phone to put on the grip shell. Do NOTdo it! Both Best Buy and Verizon said it would invalidate the warranty if you take off the back. I called Motorola Mobility and they told me the same thing. With a little effort I was able to put on the shell without taking off the back and I really like the feel. The red color is nice too!,1/29/14,1
151684,best phone I have owned,just me,R2RNANDRR6XLJ7,"we moved to this phone from a android girlfriend had a fusion 2 and I was using a galaxy s2.  We switched these over to straight talk as its much cheaper every month than the at & t pre pay, and  you get the same thing.  I wasn't sure we were going to like the windows format so we opted to get a cheaper phone, just to try the windows platform out.  I am so glad we got this phone, The call quality is outstanding, on my old phone I had a hard time hearing exactly what some people said, on this phone I hear every word crystal clear.  The connection to wi-fi is so easy with this phone and with this phone I finally use my facebook account (still think its way overrated and overused, but at least now I look at posts) because its so easy to use and set up.  the live tiles are great and while everything is always right where it should be it never really looks the same.  This phone does everything you could ask for, and then some, plus is does it very very well.  there maybe allot fewer apps but the ones that you really use are there for this phone too.  The only thing I have missed is a high quality camera with a flash, but this is the entry level phone and the camera does work well enough.",1/28/14,1
168322,Best Phone out at this time.,Joesph,R3N01QUPZN0M5Q,"I have previously owned a HTC One, Samsung Galaxy S4, and a Nokia 920. This phone is by far the best of the lot.Pros:Camera quality is amazing.Screen quality is far above the competition.Hardware is a workhorse, no application I have found, including games cause any issue on this phone.Talk quality is excellent.If you use the phone for business or work, it has Office built in plus One Note. It is the best phone for work.Possible Cons:This phone is big, It isn't as bad as I thought it would be, but it is big. I can still put it in my breast pocket, which is where I usually have it. But this phone easily replaces the need for a tablet for most.",1/2/14,1

156236,This phone is still the best out there,John,R1FUFI09L15NUB,"I have had this phone for a few months now (got it only days after VZW started carrying) and it is still the best out there in my opinion. It has it all, and has been updated a few times so it is nice to see LG making it even better.Instead of listing all of the facts and things I like about the phone, let me give you one piece of advice. GET A CASE FOR IT. There is practically no bevel on the phone and if you drop it even a few inches and it lands on a corner or the face, it will crack. Even if you hate cases (like I did, learned the hard way) get something so it creates a barrier from the glass to the surface, this is a must or I can assure you the screen will break if you drop it on a hard surface.",1/2/14,1

You can have unlimited talk and text any whereyou go.  If your going somewhere  and it takes along time you can by games and books.  If somebody is away and you want to text then you can by going on the texting app.  Its alot of money but it is worth every single penny.  If you have kids you can download books and GAMES.  The iPhone pretty much works whereever you go.  It takes about 30 min to charge it and get to a hundred.  If your battery is low it gives you a reminder.,1/2/14,1

It arrived in absolutely excellent shape (it took three days with expedited shipping: It would have been sooner if it wasn't for the New Year holiday), and I love it for it's simplicity. It even came with a charger that has a special part that can come off to turn the wall charger into a USB cable that I can plug into my laptop to charge it with. I would recommend this phone to anyone!",1/2/14,1
177801,"Love the price, love the phone!",CT,R2T5RJH7L5S0YD,"I'm so happy they finally came out with new quality phone that isn't a giant and is super affordable considering it includes nearly all the latest functions comparable to the Galaxy S4. I snagged it for $150 on Amazon Prime.I love the convenience I get using Google Now and the voice recognition system. have not been able to compare it to many other phones, but for sure, it's way faster than my old Galaxy S 4G, and I haven't had any trouble multi-tasking between web browsers, youtube, fb, tumblr, calendars, etc... Not lightning fast, but fast enough.The battery life lasts me until night with about 17 hours of varying usage throughout the day, which is new for me. The camera's okay for taking photos, not great by any means. The display is very nice to look at with great color saturation in whatever kind of lighting; by the specs, it's not the highest resolution,  but I don't feel like I'm missing anything. I'm not an audiophile,  but I can't imagine a better phone speaker. It's deafening when playing music at max volume in a small room, without distorting the sound as much as you might expect.This is my first detailed review, and I'm not a techie by any means, but I appreciate this phone (and its price) so much that I just wanted to give y'all my perspective.",1/22/14,1
157217,Great so far,Curtis Sims,R66GK6TWAPTWA,"About 3 weeks with this phone and it is Great so far. Great Pictures, large clear to read screen, easy note taking, great phone & phone messaging, movies, internet, Google, email, very useful calendar, contacts,and much more. Has many features that are very useful, I may even seek a Learning course to put to use all that is has in it.",1/12/14,1
175496,Excellent phone!,Carlos Leger Cajaledu,RYOGLQM8F12NK,"Best unlocked phone under 300 dollars. It lacks LTE, well I live in Dominican Republic and we still don't have it on phones but on USB Portable Modems only. HSDPA+ gives me 10mbps here and that's more than enough to me. Its design is great, the thickness you don't feel because of the round back. It has only 1.2GHz quad core processor, and I use  because the iPhone 5S has 1.3GHz and moves like a bullet.. The reason? iOS being less demanding, and so does Stock Android. I know it has motorola features on it so it's technically not PURE Stock Android but it's so close it's hard to tell the difference (camera features, Moto Assist app <which is great>, Motorola Migrate <which I didn't need>, and a thin line above the dock apps that was removed on stock android's 4.4 Kit Kat and was left there on 4.4 Kit Kat Moto G.. That's it, 4 differences on my count so far)It has Kit Kat 4.4 as I mentioned and it's surprisingly fluid, and I'm an advanced (heavy) user. I've not rooted, I won't do so either, I won't saturate the 1GB of RAM it has because it will start to lag. I have installed over 43 apps (just counted those on home screen which are the vast majority), and some widgets running on lockscreen.I moved from iPhone 5 with iOS 6 and I'll go back to iPhone 6 with iOS 8 when it's released because I jailbreak and have a Mac, I feel better in that ecosystem, but if I were to choose a phone to recommend to ANYONE, it's Moto G and Nexus 5 (if you have the extra 150 dollars).PS: +50gb of Google Drive space for 2 years, that's awesome =) Total size you get free is 65gb because the 50gb are EXTRA.",1/16/14,1

I popped in his AT&T; sim and he was able to get it up and running with no issue.  He works and plays on it every chance he gets when we're out at the restaurant.  So that's one phone that's got more attention than me.  LOL, but overall he was happy with the movies and music files  I loaded on his 32GB SD .  I'm an Apple lover and not a fandroid.  Not that I have any problems with Android phones (i.e. Google phone - 1st generation).  But I have to admit I love the response on it and the display is ridiculously big.  I can do the same thing pretty much on my iPad mini using Skype or Pinger to make phone calls.  Anyhow, get a case and get a Zagg Shield to protect the display from cracking and getting scratched.  Highly recommended on any big phone purchases.",2/20/14,1

154545,new to cell phones,Hoody,R1GUKOAKCJP64X,"Have had it for 3 days now, so far it works fine, am just learning my way around this cell phone stuff as its the first one I've owned, I wasn't going to go nuts on a 500 to 600 dollar thing.It does what it says it will do, I bought it mainly as a portable MP3 player, since they wew the same price. I figured why not just get this and try it out, if it didn't work I could just use it as a MP3 player. But all is just fine, I added 30 min for 10 bucks just to start, and ended up with almost 100min (3x30+10)  they started me off with 10 and 60 days service time, so when I added the 30 I ended up with 98 and 90 days service time, plenty time for me to test it out.Today I have it loaded with my MP3.s, some pic's, and have sent messages, and emails, my usual email isn't connecting right now, but that's my fault. So I'm content with it. Good cheap java OS pay as you go simi-smartphone.btw I got this thing as a referb unit, for a only 14.95, and even included the USB cable and 2gig SD card and a year warranty.Edit:Ordered 2 more for friends that wanted one, received them today, both were missing the USB cable, sent email to WorldWide about it, we'll see...Update: called the seller, will send me the 2 missing USB cables, so all is good",2/21/14,1
138902,Works in the USA,The Doctor,R1LRBH9AQZT6NQ,"This phone is local to India but comes setup in English. It works fine with an AT&T; or T-Mobile SIM card. It won't get 4G LTE speeds on those networks and may be limited to Edge, but it works fine and doesn't have to be unlocked to switch carriers. The phone itself is great and a nice value. Camera has no flash and memory is 512 MB so there are a few apps that won't work with it, but over 99% of them will work just fine. I read online that less than 1% of apps require devices with more than 512 MB RAM, so you should be good unless you need a faster, high end phone with a flash and more memory, in that case you might consider a Lumia 925, 928, 920, or 1020 (or some other model that has since come out after I posted this review).",2/3/14,1

Rackouski mracko,R17D6KWNCIT2QP,"My family has been a longtime Tracfone subscriber and we wanted to upgrade from our LG500GHL phones to smartphones.  I was  pleasantly surprised that Tracfone offered 3 phones for our area.  I narrowed it down to the Samsung Galaxy Centura and this ZTE phone.  After comparing specifications and reading a bunch of reviews I decided to go with the ZTE Valet and the family couldn't be happier.  I didn't purchase the phones here. I ended up getting them for $49.99 from Target and Best Buy.  We have only had the phones for 10 days, but no one has any complaints, so far.All the bad reviews relating to WIFI had me scared and was the biggest concern to not get this particular phone.  That fear has quickly gone away.  We get great reception through our Netgear router.  The reception is no better or worse than any of our other wireless products.  My biggest concern now is how long will the phone last.  Time will tell and I will adjust this review accordingly.Upgrading the phones through Tracfone was quick and easy.  Doing it online and following their directions was simple and pain free.  All our minutes transferred over and the phones were operating in less than 30 minutes.",2/13/14,1

Poor reception, hard to hear, higher monthly bills due to the data usage.  I wanted back to basics. I will admit loosing the QWERTY key board of the more modern phones was bit of a set back, but I do not text all that much to begin with and the phone has the T9 text with the ability to add words not found in it's dictionary.This phone has great reception, even places where the other phones would never get a signal, this thing pulls at least one bar of signal at all times.  It also has great battery life (something unheard of in the smart phone realm) I have gone a week plus in between charges on this phone.

105043,Best and toughest phone ever,Venessia,R293OOVSXXIKXQ,"I've had this phone for a year now.Note: I use this primarily as a PHONE with just a Weather/time app, calender and email widgets running 99% of the time. I only have 2 games installed and I rarely use them.I love it. Never want to get another phone but unfortunately technology marches on, but until I get an awesome job or this phone is no longer made I will continue on with this phone.pros:its cheapit works 95% of the time(see cons for the other %5)I've accidentally dropped it MANY times from various heights and it still works as well as the day I bought it.not really a con but not really a pro maybe kinda:the screen is made of plastic, which means it can get scratched(not easily but it happens), invest in screen protectors or a case. However this also means it doesn't SHATTER when you accidentally drop it.cannot put or run tons of apps on the phone ( :c ) but anyways for me this is a communication device rather than a entertainment devicecons:Operating system is a bit quirky? it restarts by itself every now and then that's about it.Battery life: if you're in an area with no/very low reception put it on airplane mode or you will have a dead phone in less than an hour. Otherwise it lasts about 6-8 hours if you don't use it, or 4-6 hours if you take long calls on it.If you're out and about always carry a spare charger with you, this not only helps you but also your fiends/family/coworkers who need a charge lol.",2/11/14,1

169386,Great Device! Excellent Service!,Amazon Customer,R3PN5Z2FSAVUM1,"I needed a phone for my business strictly for texting on nights and weekends. This phone surpassed what I was expecting, and it arrived a day early! It is easy to use if you are familiar with android and you get TRIPLE minutes every time you reload it! That is such an outstanding perk! This is much less expensive than adding another contracted line. I will suggest this to anyone who doesn't need lots of data or tons of calling minutes. I purchased 120 mins/calls/data and 360 were loaded to this phone. You won't be unhappy with this purchase and it will save you a TON OF $$$$$$$$$$$",2/10/14,1

131391,Great phone for the money,Nicholas,R2OQM79E97VGNR,"Keys are spaced nicely for fast typing, and it connects very easily to the Assurance Wireless network which is run by Virgin.  Clear sound, and great quality overall, especially for the price.  You can't beat it.  Camera is okay, several useful tools (alarm, calculator, calendar, notes), decent web browsing capabilities (don't expect an iphone browser), and just a decent phone overall.  If you're on a budget, I would DEFINITELY recommend this phone.",2/7/14,1

105924,Solid Quality and great user interface. (Perfect for at&t; networks),jake,R1Z8DYNN1V83WI,"This model was originally designed to be sold in south america yet its perfectly suited for north american GSM bands. 3g works flawlessly on airvoicewireless/ which is a sublet of AT&T.; This phone is the perfect compact size yet very capable of wonderful graphics and online activities. I searched all over the web to find a smaller phone with good features and this is the only one I found closest to the size of an iphone with same or better functionality! Its very comfortable and easy to use with one hand. Build quaility is on the high end and it does not feel like some cheap plastic. It does not come preloaded with too many apps, but the playstore provides any possible app for free. The processor on this device is on the lower end but I was quite surprised with its functionality, lightning fast user interface. Pages load as quick as an iphone, it has really comfortable pinch to zoom and readability is a breeze. I compare this with some of the newer phones on the market like blackberry z10 (which i had returned) and Motorola still wins the battle. For anyone who doesnt wanna spend 600 for iphone, this is a very adequate choice that should be more than satisfying.",2/24/14,1
120752,LOVE LOVE LOVE. Goodbye iPhone,Stephanie Eisentrout,R1DUYUKA2U3Z8V,"My switch from apple to windows:  Let me just say I have never really been a fan of the iPhone. It's just not my personal preference. I know there are plenty of people that like it, but not me...I was worried though switching from my iPhone to something where my app options were going to be completely foreign. Even if I love windows 8 for my desktop - I was hesitant about going to windows 8 mobile. I'm SO GLAD I made the change.Also, here is a novel idea. When I plug this thing into my computer via usb - guess what happens.....I CAN VIEW MY FILES AND MUSIC. I never wanted to resort to jailbreaking my iPhone because it permanently damaged my boyfriend's phone, and another friend we have had a heck of a time with his jailbreak. While this may be a problem that is generally few and far between - being as I was running my phone on a prepaid network and already had issues with that, I didn't want to jailbreak the phone. I shouldn't have to jailbreak a phone that is meant to play music in order to complete the generally simple task of loading music on the dang thing.The actual physical phone: I love the slim & sleek design, the very easy to use touch screen, the sensitivity adjustments for the touch screen, and the overall quality and feel. The screen size is perfect for my use. I was considering getting a tablet before I had this phone, and while this isn't exactly tablet-sized...I may actually skip the tablet for the time being.",2/17/14,1
139716,GREAT PHONE!!!,Ricardo Boodlal,R1L001GZX7L2DK,"Totally in love with my new HTC One. Small, sleek, comfortable, runs everything smoothly. Can't complain. Only downside is all the preloaded apps from AT&T; that it come with. Useless junk that takes up space.You can get rid of some, but not all. Was expecting a bit more wow for the ultrapixels too but still has great photo quality compared to other phones.",2/28/14,1
151266,AWESOME PHONE,Texas Grandma,R1DUEFK27T012P,"This is my first Nokia phone and I am very impressed with the performance of the 520.

169409,great phone for $25!,Jill Angst,R1JS06CKYQ9ZYX,"This phone is great for the money!  Using APPMGRIII to move and uninstall various apps I had enough memory with a good deal left to install Netflix, Android Weather, Map Navigator (stand-alone GPS), and about 10 games for the kids.  Good phone for texting, calls, and light app use.  Wifi works great making browsing the internet quick and easy, as well.  Not at all bad for $25.",2/16/14,1
170867,Moto G phone,Amazon Customer,R1R6H6R4LMKHCP,This is a great phone.  The screen is very clear and everything is sharp.  The 16gb limit didn't bother me much.  Bayreuth life is pretty good.  I wonder if Lenovo is going to continue to develop the Moto line of phones.,2/18/14,1

91185,1.5 Year and going!,Rob,R2V0X1Q1W04R8A,"After a year and a half, it still the best phone ever.Based on a year and a half of moderate use. Supported by a 65mps internet service (home wifi).Battery: 12 hours standby on wifi/ 16 hours standby without wifi/ 5-6 hours excessive talk and text(with/without wifi) / 7-8 hours excessive text (with/without wifi). Tested on low-mid screen brightness.Call Quality: Superb. Only lack in call quality is in poor reception or the outgoing phone.Speaker Volume: Crisp and clean. Really loud in a quiet room. Slightly quiet with over 20-25 people talking over each other.GPS: Very fast on wifi. Can still track without wifi, but cannot relocate if you miss your exit/turn.Gaming: great for moderate gaming. Nothing to intense and can only support games built for Gingerbread. Still playing all facebook apps and etc.Picture capture: Great quality when focused, and blurry when unfocused. Flash is super bright!Picture viewing: can view photos over 1600x900 (re-sized when viewed but makes great wall paper).Video Recording: Records amazing @480P. Flash can be enabled during recording. Great Plus!Media Video: 480P maximum. Still great quality on youtube.Music: can be played if apps allow the music player to be used. Music player can however use a more friendly interface. Thus the toolbar for the music player is amazing. Any music sound file will play in the music media player witch can be a good or negative.External SDcard cap:32gb and the phone reads it like a charm. can set pictures/videos to be stored on card to save phone space.Overall a great phone and a must buy if you are a first time smart phone purchaser or looking for a replacement. This has all the kinks. Scrolling is still smooth like butter. Better then the SG3,4, and note IMO. No cracks yet (thank lord). Dropped from stock truck height (4 feet) face down and no scruffs about 5 times now. Froze 4 times but only at my fault. Only thing i didnt like about it was the 160 character text limit before it converts to a multimedia file, but it is common in all android phone due to the system software, so no grudge hold on this phone. Will buy it again in a heart beat. extremely satisfied.",2/15/14,1
60892,Perfect,Gil Straub,R2NG9CHU0CFC1G,"This phone was everything as advertised, and more. It arrived safe and sound in a factory sealed box and has been operating perfect so far. I would not hesistate to recommend this supplier.",2/20/14,1

102006,Excellent quality and great for seniors,InformedConsumer,RF3YC3SWCDWUB,"NOTE:As there is frequent variation in the quality of service provided even within a phone company, I am not reviewing the Jitterbug Greatcall service, only the hardware of the phone.THE PROS:This is the first phone I've ever seen that is actually designed for seniors or others with vision or hearing problems: large buttons, a bright backlit display, a simple yes/no system instead of red and green unlabeled buttons, up-and-down arrows instead of an unlabeled multi-directional pad, easy access to the speakerphone function, and stripped-down programming that has nothing by the bare essentials.It does not rely on red and green buttons, which is a huge plus for those who are colorblind or losing their ability to distinguish colors as they age.The phone's number is constantly displayed across the top of the screen, for those who have a hard time remembering their number.The battery charges within a few hours, and holds its charge well when in use, and can standby for at least two weeks when not in use.Both the ringer and speaker are loud enough for those who may have trouble hearing.THE â€œYOU SHOULD KNOWâ€ùS:None.THE CONS:The battery indicator is hard to to find in the phone's system. Non-tech-savvy users must rely on the phone buzzing to alert for low or critically low battery.THE END RESULTS:For anyone who has any kind of difficulty seeing, hearing, or just isn't inclined to wrestle with complicated phone operating systems, this is a great basic option.",2/16/14,1

Lots of great widgets that can be resized to your taste. Speaker quality is great, my ringtones sound much better than they did on my old phone. Camera is decent. Screen size and quality is optimum.The only issue I had with it is not really even an issue. The pre-installed ringtones are terrible boarding on nightmare causing.

PocketableTech YouTube ChannelFollow me on Twitter @ PocketableTechIf your looking for a phone that takes passable photos for social media sites like Instagram and Twitter and you're more concerned with price, pixels, and functionality, then the Moto G will make you VERY happy.||||||||CONS||||||||1. Lack of LTE.2. NO micro SD expansion3. Average 5MP autofocus lens4. Distorted loud speaker at high volume.5. 1GB of RAM which for the most part functions fine but every now and then stutters when switching between apps.6. The screen can be hard to view in direct sunlight since the screen brightness doesn't get bright enough to combat the brightness of direct sun.||||||||PROS||||||||1. Price - $179 USD Off-contract (+$20 for 8GB more = 16GB for $199)<---definitely recommend the higher storage capacity.2. Amazing Battery performance!3. Nano Coating (water resistant to an extent)4. Beautiful HD DISPLAY - Screen sharpness - Pixels!!!5. Customizability (the ability to change the back shell)6. Running up-to-date stock android 4.4 Kit Kat (2.15.2014)",2/19/14,1
126041,Why Tracfone works for me......,Jane,R1ES3J0UZ7A16P,"Have been using Tracfone for years.  Works great for me.  Would recommend, it's cost effective if you don't use your cell phone often.  Mine lives in my purse, turned off unless I need it!",2/5/14,1
121397,multi-tasker at its best,George W. Aguilar,R1KGE9A3FENF0C,"This has got to be the best phone I've ever owned. I temporarily got the new version (Note 3) and returned it in about a week.  Donâ€™t get me wrong, the Note 3 is a very nice and extremely capable phone. However, it came with one deal-breaking issue: display.Note 2 will give those vibrant colors that just pop.  Great for gaming and movies.  The Note 3â€™s display is FULL HD but even with all that clarity, the colors look noticeably dull.  The Note 2 has a 1280x800 display may not be as super clear but, it has great color representation.Iâ€™d opt for the vivid color over the FULL HD display any day.  Save some money and frustration, get yourself the Note 2.  Btw, I got mine 9 months from when it was released and still have it.",2/1/14,1

155731,A great phone!,L. Crawford,R1HTMNU6H0ZZFQ,"I'll admit, this is my first smart phone. I have used all my friends phones. Galaxy, HTC One, iPhone (multiple generations), etc. The Moto X is my favorite though. It is the perfect size and fits perfectly in your hand (if you want a case that still feels great I recommend the SupCase). The voiceless controls are great, admittedly a bit buggy but they are getting better with every update and the active notifications are the best feature of a phone I've seen. The camera isn't the best, but I'm not really a picture taker so I don't mind. This comes highly recommended! I've had no problems with it at all.",2/12/14,1

Had problem getting text msg from Iphone uses but called Blu customer service and they told me what my IPhone friends had to do in order for me to receive their texts. Phone is big and I wasn't sure if I would like it but after a few days of using I liked it! Put AT&T; sim card in and was ready to go. Also some complained that they could not get cases to fit but I found lots on Amazon and ordered it fits perfectly. I'm not a big phone user and find this phone fits my needs.,2/11/14,1

174471,Great phone.  Motorola hit the spot,Roman,R2KKH52J5MHGW1,"I think this is great smartphone which delivers high end features at price of budget phone.I think Motorola packed perfect features into this device for more than reasonable price.It also fits the biggest needs of every average android phone user.-As of now (feb.  2014) there are absolutely no competition for this phone at this price point.  It's simple as that,  there are no KitKat phones at this price point.  There are no phones with such a good screen at this price point. No other smartphone has a comparable battery life at this price.  And in fact it has better specs and features than some $300 phones.-4.5 ideal screen size that makes it not to big or too small and easy on most user's eyes.  300+ppi is ideal density,  because eye can no longer trace pixels on the screen.-battery life is great (around 5hr of screen time,  it might vary on use but its better than most phones) and its one of the important factor in smartphones-very quick and responsive.  Screen is very responsive to touches which makes it very easy to type fast.  Browsing around phone has no lag or delays.  Apps load fast.-OS might be unimportant to 90% of users,  but KitKat is what makes this phone so good.-Ok camera.  I would really love to buy a high end phone without 20mp camera just to save a few bucks.  And thats why moto g has an average camera,  because it's not the most important feature of the phone and it could be easily replaced with 5mp camera whithout too many users even noticing.  Nokia with 41mp camera has an insane price exactly for that reason,  mean while  rest of whone spects is nothing special for the price.-Micro SD slot is a handy feature,  but few free gigabytes on the phone is OK for most.  My guess would be it's most important feature for kids,  teenagers and early young adults because of all the music and games they need.  So again,  you can have a few big games and 100 songs in  8gb version and still have some space left.",2/16/14,1
142074,Best Phone Upgrade Ever.,Disappointed,R1SWVL2WPTBKUS,"Not much to say here I am a fan of Android and Samsung AMOLID display technology.  After running the benchmark application, (Quadrant Standard), this phone blows away all comers.I always do me research on phonearena.com, prior to any new cell phone purchase.",2/27/14,1
173359,A good value phone!,Yew Meng Tham,R12ROZZKVWMBRM,The moto G is an exceptional phone because of the reasonably good specs vs the attractive price .It is one to consider for those who need a second phone.It has met up to my expectation; BUT it will be better if it comes in dual SIM model.Thank you,2/17/14,1
83726,Amazing!,Brenda Perez,R1J9O88YQXMQQE,Most amazing place to get an IPhone! I got it for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it! It said it would be delivered in a week or two I got it within a week. It didn't take that long at all. The phone was in great condition. It was a used one. You couldn't even tell! It works great! I give the service 5 stars' amazing! Really reliable I will definitely use them again.,2/23/14,1
155960,One of the best smartphones,Gabriel Pita Gabriel Pita,R20IEP2X2TP0II,"Pros:- Great battery life, 2 days on regular use (calls, IM, social networks, some photos & videos) and 1 full day on heavy use (streaming, web browsing) and that's without using stamina mode.- Fast and responsive UI thanks to the Quad-core processor and 2GB RAM.- Great camera, could be better in low light conditions but still better than almost every other smartphone, if they can update the firmware to avoid the overprocessing of the images it could be the best smartphone camera.- Great build quality.- Water & dust proof.Cons:- No KitKat yet.- The Z1's screen claims to be scratch proof, but it comes with a screen protector pre-installed that is easily scratched (I already scratched mine just by putting the phone in my jean's pocket), You can remove this screen protector but you lose the sony logo because is burned in it.Hardware wise, there are few phones that can match the Z1, the display might not be the shiniest one out there but i think it reflects true color and not some saturated version of an image. Some people has complaints about the viewing angles but i can't see what is the big buzz about that.In short, The Z1 is currently one of the best smartphones of the market, Sony is going in the right direction.",2/20/14,1

170287,Excellent Phone for an excellent price,Nellcinne Crooks,RD7CCF61DX0NN,This is a great phone.  I went to the Caribbean on vacation and the phone worked perfectly.  I used a local sim card and it was very easy to install.  The screen is huge and the colors are vibrant.  It's easy to touch and easy to use.  All the functionality work perfectly and lots of features to personalize the phone. It mimics the Galaxy Note for less than half the price.  I will definitely order a Lightahead phone again.  Good job!!!,2/7/14,1

174475,Mediocre camera doesn't dent the amazing value,Michael Holst,R2NXRXYQCOO3W5,"If this were a more expensive phone, I'd probably not rate it 5 stars.However for $180-$200 you get a performant smartphone that is more than adequate for the tasks that most of us require (I don't game on the phone). Plus you get the latest version of Android, in an almost pristine skin.While the image capture isn't great, the camera UI is WAY better than the crappy stock Android one (circle UI).If Motorola / Google / Lenovo improved the image quality, they'd have produced the perfect smartphone for the masses, and that is a commendable feat.",2/14/14,1
142322,Amazing phone,Amazon Customer,R27QMYDQRD14RV,I had MetroPCS before this and decided to switch to Verizon because my sister's phone (Huawei Vitria) was not working when mine (Alcatel One Touch Fierce) did. It would say she had service but would not send or receive texts as well as not calling out or receiving calls.I made the switch through Verizon and have had the phone for two days now and my sister and I absolutely love it. It's fast and I haven't had any problems with service or calls and it overall works great. I definitely recommend the Samsung Galaxy S4 from Verizon!!,2/6/14,1
10059,great for mom,Da Pearl,R134JDDDMPMHDA,"mom has trouble keeping her cell phone with her, and this is a good solution. If she has a problem or feels ill, she has her cell phone within reach at all times to call me. I bought the pink, the blue, and the green.",2/4/14,1

156715,You bet!,Laoblue,R2HIFMUXBHEGS5,"Great phone!  Has a solid feel with metal-like, firm edges that don't cut into your palm like to older version.  Speaker is on the bottom, so audio is clear - unlike the older version.  The camera iawry ally good for a phone!  Once you get to know all the functions, you will be impressed!  Close-up shots are the best though.  Landscape shots suffer a little in detail when blown-up, and there is some purpling with the sunshine - maybe because of the small lense.  Great screen too, any bigger would be a pad, with vivid colors and fantastic detail.Ok, all the great things....the no-so-great...is the battery, but I don't play lots of games or watch movies, so no problem.  It wont last long if you are a heavy gamer in between texting or calls.  And come on, this is a thin phone, what can you really hope to get out of the thin battery?  Yeah, the phone is a little heavy and bulky, especially for a gal, I would think.  Also, like other phones, it can get warm to the touch after playing games, or operating the camera for a while - a nice hand warmer maybe.",2/2/14,1

174484,More than meets the eye... And the buck.,Martin Garcia,RU9KQ0ZZ3UPFT,"I've wanted an Android smartphone for quite some time, and I had a lot of other options on my mind, but they weren't really affordable to me. I read some really nice things about this phone, so I decided to give ti a try. So far, I'm anything but disappointed; this little fella has a lot more juice than it shows, and is worth a lot more than 200 bucks; I couldn't have made a better choice. If you want an affordable but powerful Android phone, this is the one for you.Pros:-Decent performance-Pure, unbloated Andriod: Yes-Clear, perfect sound during callsCons:-Camera is regular at best-No expandable memory; comes with free, imited-time Google Drive to compensate",2/11/14,1

155022,"Great device, one of the best Android devices I've owned",JSutherland125,R1ZQKEZXVMPYXM,"The Moto X is a solid, well built and comfortable device to use. The UI is very close to stock Android and because of this it gets updates (in general) faster than most other Android phones.The only negative I can take away from this AT&T; branded device is that the bloatware AT&T; has bundled with the device causes battery drain due to not letting the phone go into deep sleep. Yes, many applications do this, but the reason I make this statement is that you cannot remove it or disable it without rooting the device. Go with the unlocked GSM device to rid yourself of AT&T; junk apps.",2/5/14,1

Go for it if you are just looking at options between Samsung s4 or LG G2. The 1080p screen has beautiful colors and so clear picture quality. The processes are so fast that you don't see a single lag.,2/5/14,1
178233,So Far So Good!,mjwilli75,RY39RFKI54HLK,"I had been looking for a smartphone that wouldn't break the bank and purchased the BLU Dash 5.0 after reading just two great reviews and contacting both BLU and Amazon about returning the phone if necessary.  So far the phone has been great.  I did have to switch to T-Mobile (BLU rep suggested this) but I am very pleased with the phone and the service.  The phone does not look or work like an inexpensive phone and people with the more expensive ones are impressed with the phone as much as I am. As for the accessories: the Samsung S4 screen saver fits, but it did come with two. It came with a soft plastic back cover and I found a wallet type carrier on Amazon that works great when I carry the phone in by messenger bag. I would definitely recommend the BLU Dash 5.0 to new smartphone users who are looking for an inexpensive phone.  Like I said, so far so good!",2/24/14,1

162214,Great phone overall!!!,Rob B.,R37G10PBGY34LY,"This is one of the best phones you can get without a doubt.  The feel of it is just amazing.  It feels like a top of the notch piece of hardware and not a plasticky cheap phone.  I have had it for three months now and I am absolutely satisfied with it.  It is extremely fast.  My last phone was an iPhone 4s and it was fast.  I tried the Samsung S4 and it was a lot less responsive.  It lagged when flicking and was not as fast as one would desire from a high end phone, so I went for the Z1 which is extremely responsive.  Apps open really fast and it never gets stalled.  You can really feel the power of the processor.  The screen is superb.  Very clear and true to colours and the size is just perfect.  The installed Chrome explorer works very well and every website renders fast and with no glitches.  Very customisable and widgets are great if you like to change your home screen once in a while and don't feel stuck with the same home screen forever as you are with the iPhones.  The Small Apps features is also great.  It lets you have two windows opened in the screen at the same time.  The camera takes outstanding pictures with good and bad light and works great underwater.  The special shutter button located in the side of the phone makes it very easy to operate.  The battery lasts a full day with heavy usage and has the low battery mode and stamina mode that really help when you are running low.  Led notifications on the front of the phone are really helpful too and very cleverly located.There are a couple of things that have been critiqued about this phone, like vision angles.  I really don't understand what is the big fuzz about that.  You never watch your phone holding it in an angle position.  At least I always hold it looking straight at me and it looks perfect.  Secondly, the size.  If you want a small phone this is not for you.  If you are tired of small phones where everything looks, well small, this is the one.  It is big, but thin and does not feel bulky at all when you are holding it, and it is definitely the most high-end-looking phone out there.  The speakers are not that great so if you use your phone a lot to hear music out loud, this is probably not the best option.  However, most people normally use headphones (which sound great) or bluetooth speakers which you can connect very easily with the NFC connection, just by holding the two devices close to one another.  And there is the issue of the scratches.  Turns out that Sony for reasons that I cannot understand, decided to cover the glass front and back screens with shatter-resitant screen protector that are very bad at scratch-protection.  The phone scratches just by using your fingers to unlock it or by flicking.  I was very dissapointed because of this so I called Sony and they told me about the factory-installed screen-protectors.  They told me that I could get rid of them but that I should take into account that the SONY logo would be gone since it is printed in the screen protector and not in the glass (??????!!!!!!).  Anyway, I decided to retire the front screen protector and leave the one in the back.  I lost the logo (which doesn't really bothered me), but the screen looks perfect and the glass is really good with scratches.Overall, I am very satisfied with this phone and would recommend it to anyone.",2/19/14,1
141931,Great phone for son,Kimberly M. Brown,R1Z8RC7VYXCYB7,"This is a great phone and has plenty of features for my son, who wanted a Smartphone, but has to live on a tight budget. The Straight Talk plan is prepaid and he loves the phone!!",2/4/14,1

121101,Great little starter phone,Kristen G,RUQVZ2FGP49PO,"I was looking for an inexpensive and simple little phone for my 7 year old daughter who has recently started quite a few after school programs. Since she is young, I didn't want something with a lot of bells and whistles, and something we could easily monitor while being easy for her to use. This phone is great for that. It fits comfortably in the palm of her hand, very easy to access the pre-programmed numbers we put in, and we easily disabled the internet and other extras. She absolutely LOVES it, and we have a little piece of mind knowing that she has something in case of emergency (or if something is either delayed or let out early)! We also purchased a cookie style case (hard plastic clips over each side, then silicone on top) for $6. Between that, and this coming with 600 minutes/1yr service, we are all very happy with this!",2/13/14,1

I ended up having to go to the AT&T; store to get a new sim card (no charge by AT&T;) as her old sim card would not work in this phone. Two weeks later she left the first phone in her pants pocket and ran it through the washing machine. Not really a good idea!!!

151110,A totally unfair comparison...,Edward Scott ewscott,R2MWTIDLVOUNRV,"This is a preliminary review, just received today, but I have been exposed to my wife's 520 for a month now and already know most of the features and delights.My old phone (which will finally be thrown as far into the woods as I can heave it) was a Samsung Flight II... the worst phone ever made... Probably bought by Samsung from some North Korean sweatshop... a true scam of a phone... read my review if you want a laugh.A lot of what I like about this phone is the Windows O/S... so simple and user friendly... very thoughtful layout and operation.  Every I-Phone and Samsung owner my wife has shown her (cheap) Lumia to has said they will buy one of these.  I won't go through all of the features, I just want to say they work, they are easy and logical and quick.I'm sure I'll add more to this review as I continue to marvel at it... it's at least 1000 times better than my old Samsung side slider and half the price!Oh... forgot to mention the good service at ATT when I had them set my phone up with the same number I had before. (since the old phone was dumb, not smart, I couldn't just swap sim cards). I had a hard time finding the right number to call, but the tech (name Ty) was so helpful and so kind, taking as much time as I needed to magnify the tiny numbers on the sim card, looking for the mislaid back cover so I could turn it on, etc.  Thank you so much ATT....OK a little confusion to me because I was originally told these phones would do wifi even if you've never turned on AT&T; data service... that's TRUE, but my router had to be changed before I could do it... something to do with static dns, which I don't understand much about, but my savvy brother helped me get it going.  I don't really need internet on my phone though because our home has a desktop, a chromebook and two Tab 3s :)  Maybe someday I'll be somewhere that I need internet and there's wifi available, but I can't really foresee that.Favorite feature:  (not that I advocate driving and using a cellphone) ... but you don't even have to look at your phone to make a call, just press the windows button at the center bottom, it beeps, then say Call (Name) and the phone voice responds Calling (Name)... ring ring talk talk, eyes on the road.UPDATE:  Still very pleased with this phone and discovering new features every week.  Looks great, even with the case.............but where is the $ dollar sign symbol?  I can't find it!  There IS a British Pound symbol, but not $.  Another note... I have now used wifi at several locations, even while sitting in the parking lot at a shopping center, thanks to a nearby bistro.  It's a great feature when you need to entertain yourself or use facebook, etc.",2/20/14,1

So far the phone has been great.  I did have to switch to T-Mobile (BLU rep suggested this) but I am very pleased with the phone and the service.  The phone does not look or work like an inexpensive phone and people with the more expensive ones are impressed with the phone as much as I am. As for the accessories: the Samsung S4 screen saver fits, but it did come with two. It came with a soft plastic back cover and I found a wallet type carrier on Amazon that works great when I carry the phone in by messenger bag. I would definitely recommend the BLU Dash 5.0 to new smartphone users who are looking for an inexpensive phone.  Like I said, so far so good!",2/24/14,1

I work with a bunch of driod heads and I pulled this baby out and all of them swarmed to see what I had. Some of them were kind of jealous the others were like bet you got s*** for apps I showed those guys how it was linked to my xbox live account and had xbox games in my downloads. Granted I miss some of the apps that I had on my moto HD but this one has made up for it in the terms of being able to sync with all of my windows devices at home whether I'm at home or not. It doesn't have an SD card slot..which I read in a review and it kinda scared me, but it has 30gigs of internal storage.....it doesn't need the sd slot...lol I was taken back by that like whoa 30gigs internal in a phone...woot I've also had connection where other people with the same carrier had none so it has a very sensitive antennae with fast refresh it seems cause if I found that sweetspot and moved it lost a bar or two. Battery life is solid, charges a bit slow, but holds power for 2 days if you aren't using it a lot. Great phone for first time windows phone users, not sure how previous winphone users would take this one. It's all about what you want your phone to do and this does it for me VERY well.

I've had the phone for nearly a month now, and it is so much better than the Nokia Lumia 521 I had. The only semi-complaint I have is that the touchscreen isn't always very responsive- probably due to the type of glass that is used.Again, this phone is fantastic, but make sure you know its limitations:-Edge, H+, and 3G only, not 4G capable-No front facing camera or flash.

185191,The (New)ONE to Rule Them All!,Johnny SaigonÂ®,R1G95K9F2TQFE9,"I love HTC phones and I have both last year's One(m7) and this year's(m8). I am NOT affiliated with HTC or compensated by them in any way. I just feel that competition and the underdog companies are crucial and essential for a healthy free market economy, and ultimately, us consumers. I have had the iPhones 4 through 5s, Samsung Galaxy S3/S4 and Note 2/3, and several Nokia(n95-97, n84/85 and several lesser phones) and Sony/Sony-Ericsson(Xperia) phones over the years, and I have loved most of them. For a healthy and positive technological evolution, we NEED the small or struggling companies like HTC to succeed. If Apple and Samsung become duopolies, that will be a dark future indeed. Pick up an HTC One(M7 or M8) and any Samsung Galaxy phones and compare the quality and craftsmanship, and tell me why it's Samsung and not HTC that have more successful phones. It's all about the MONEY and marketing, the bigger guy trying to squeeze out the smaller guy, and that's NOT how a healthy free market economy should be.Now that that is out of the way, let us get down to the nitty gritty. This is my direct comparisons to the iPhone 5s, Samsung Galaxy S4/S5 and Note 3, but mainly to the last HTC One(M7)(and yes, I am mainly updating keypoints from the m7 review):The Good:1) THE SCREEN: If there was such a better screen on a phone, I have not yet seen it. The iPhone 5s is lauded for its excellent screen, but at its current resolution, it trails behind the One's screen by far. Everything just POPS out at you. Even in direct sunlight, everything is CLEAR and BRIGHT. I really loved the 2013 HTC One's(M7) screen, but once again HTC has outdone itself and given us a true masterpiece in 5.0 1080p(440ppi) form. The main difference between the M8 and the M7 is the color reproduction on the M8 is better and more true-to-life. This is THE BEST screen on the planet right now - WOW!!!2) THE DESIGN/HARDWARE: Once again, the new One continues the HTC tradition of making really high-quality phones with high-class material and craftsmanship. This version has more of a matted-brushed aluminum finish than the glossier M7. The One feels THICK and TOUGH. I don't have to worry about carrying this around case-less(except from drops, which is a whole other issue). I will not be worried about this phone nicking and scraping like the iPhone 5/5s. Personally, it may not have the flair of some of the Sony and Nokia phone of the past, but in totality the One has the best combination of design and craftsmanship. It oozes style and sophistication, unlike the plastic-y feel of the Samsung Galaxy S4/S5. The One is one real looker!3) THE DUAL FRONT-FACING SPEAKERS: We have all been desensitized to the modern smartphones nowadays with their crappy, tinny, mono speaker. I remember the days of the Nokia n95 and n84 with their stereo speakers - whatever happened to phones after that? Whoever agreed to a mono/solo speaker with all the smartphones thereafter?? FINALLY, someone has the senses to come back to reality - thank you, HTC!. Trust me, your ears will thank you and you will realize all phones should have been made like this. Especially when you use ringtones/alerts that were specifically created for this phone, the sound is loud, immersive, expansive, and POPs into your ears. It's simply a re-revolution. Compared to the M7, the M8 loses the Beats audio engineering, but it actually sounds louder than the M7, which although has really high-quality speakers as well, was known for being too soft in certain scenarios. The new moniker is just BoomSound.4) THE CAMERA: I don't use my phone camera to make prints from photos, I have my dedicated cameras for that. So to me, the paramount function of phone cameras is the convenience/accessibility - it has to be able to capture what I want quickly and clearly, with decent enough quality to post online. Therefore, the 4MP size in the One's camera does not bother me at all. Who cares if the camera isn't THE BEST phone camera ever? Because it is not, but it is a GREAT low-light shooter, and to me that's more important than pixel count. The sensors in the camera are bigger than other phone cameras, therefore, it can capture a lot more light, which in laymen's terms it can give you better photos in more situations than other phone cameras can. Also, the touch spot focus is almost instantaneous - this camera is quick, quick, quick! What's really cool about the new camera is the duo camera functionality - each photo you snap is recorded from both cameras, so afterwards, you can re-focus the image, ala Lytro camera style. This is really cool and quite revolutionary for a phone camera. So in the real world, this means no more out-of-focus photos! You can now always re-focus your photos after the fact, so you will not have to regret missing out on a great memory because your photo was out of focus - awesome!5) For a phone with a 5 screen, it's quite svelte, at least at the girth. It's easier to hold in the hand than the Samsung Galaxy S4/S5, and for sure a heckuva lot better than the Note 3. It fits in your hands nicely and securely, with just the right combination of size, weight, and balance. However, it is very TALL, even taller than the M7, so trying to reach the power button with one hand while your holding it in a normal position is almost impossible. HOWEVER...6) The One borrows the features of the LG G2 where you can double tap on the screen while it's off, to turn it on! While the screen is off, you can swipe left to turn it on to see Blinkfeed, which is HTC's version of Flipboard/news reader, and swipe right to turn it on to the home screen. The one thing HTC forgot though, is you can't double-tap the screen while it's on, to turn it off, which the LG G2 CAN do.7) The user interface(UI) and software design is now even more polished,minimal, and simplistic. Sense 6.0 is the on-going improvement from the previous versions. It's really quick and light, not bloated like Samsung's TouchWiz UI. It improves on the older, but still good, Sense 5.0 and 5.5. You can move from one screen to the next lightning quick, almost as good as the iPhone UI.8) And FINALLY, HTC has included a microSD slot so you can add your own memory card for more storage(the HTC DNA/Butterfly and M7 didn't have any). You can add up to 128gb more!The Bad and Ugly:1) The battery is only 2600mAh - I wish it was bigger because I'm one of those paranoid people who always needs my phone at fully charged, just in case, of you know, something. But so far it's been holding steady at about 40% at the end of the day(from 9am-6pm). I check emails, read the news, text, Facebook, etc. throughout the day - I would say that I'm a moderate to heavy user. At least it is a lot better than the M7's 2300mAh battery, which drains super quick, yet charges SUPER SLOW.2) Comparing features with the Samsung S4/S5, the One is not as good. It's not a deal breaker, but for those who like fancy functions, the One will not make you as happy. The HTC One is very simple in its feature set. The one feature I miss most from the new Samsung phones is Smart Stay, where the phone can sense that you're looking at the screen, and won't dim/turn off the screen - that was a HUGE convenience for when you're watching a movie or reading the news. The coolest feature so far for the One has been the tap/swipe to turn the screen on.3) Like I wrote earlier, the size is both good and bad, and it's also heavier than most similar phones. It's taller than the S4/S5, and with the power button up on top, it's almost impossible to do one-hand phone operations without shifting your hand up and down to accommodate both the screen gestures and buttons. The buttons(power and volume) don't protrude enough to make it easy to press them.All in all, I feel the combination of the One's screen, design/craftsmanship, and audio experience trumps over the Samsung S4/S5's fancy functions. The S5's screen is almost just as good - AMOLED screens are known for their deep blacks and saturation, while the One's is much better in direct light, and with a more true color reproduction. The S5 has a higher MP camera, therefore able to take better photos in broad daylight, while the One's camera is more versatile and better in low light conditions. The One has a much better audio experience, while the S5 gives you better convenience with its features - userability goes to the S5 for sure.But in the end, considering the totality of things, I feel the new HTC One provides me the best TOTAL experience, and is the king of the smartphones(at least for now!).",3/26/14,1

135808,pleasantly surprised,Brian H. Myers,RAPVKD8NOM84H,"I was really skeptical about placing an order online for this phone, especially bc I couldn't see it in person, I wasn't sure if it came with a SIM card for straighttalk (it did not state if it did)...but I was pleasantly surprised that this phone was as good as NEW, I LOVE IT, especially for the price, you truly can't beat that!! It, also, did come with a SIM card for straighttalk, along with a number to call. The ONLY thing was that I did request for was faster shipping and it still took almost 2 weeks to receive - but I can't really complain too much bc it snowed here and the weather may have permitted it later or bc it was being shipped to a PO Box. Anyways, I do love this phone and are very happy, I will buy from you in the future. :)",3/4/14,1

84902,Great flip phone with some web functionality,Big Ed,R10XDBYSEELZTE,"Pros:Excellent sound qualityExcellent ring volumeExcellent mid size displayVery compact and pocket friendlyIncredible battery life, particularly on standbyAdequate camera and camcorderBuilt in email, Google, and a variety of social media appsBuilt in utilities like calendar, alarms, MP3 playerUses optional micro sdhc memory card (I use 16gb)Features like ringtones and wallpaper highly customizableNo problem using USB cable to connect it to PC.  Files can be easily manipulated using Windows or KIES (including pictures and videos)Cons:No external display (which probably helps with the battery life)User guide is a cruel joke, and nearly all online searches point back to itTime of day has to be set manuallyKeypad is adequate but there are others I like betterNote that I love this phone 5 stars worth in spite of the cons.  The Consumer Cellular SIM card popped in and went right to work, although it did take some doing to set up the internet access (because this is an unlocked AT&T; phone and not a native Consumer Cellular phone some advanced settings deep in the menus were needed).  I mainly use it to talk and text and replace my wrist watch.  I'm not a heavy user, but I carry it all the time on standby, and need to charge it much less than once a week.All in all, this is a nearly perfect compromise between basic flip phone and smart phone.",3/21/14,1

I held it up against my samsung galaxy and it is the same size screen even though I thought the nokia was smaller, my bad.  I am amazed at what I got for the price I paid, considering what the galaxy phone does and the price I paid for it.  I wish I had found this phone first.  Great camera apps.

7318,Motorola RAZR V3,William Toth Jr.,R384SYP94F0YOA,"I bought this phone NEW 5 years ago from a local mom and pop store. I did not buy it for any other reason but basic communication. This phone's front-end is more sensitive than other cell phones I owned and picks up weak cell towers where previously I experienced dropped calls. Secondly, the sound quality is great which is part of communication. It is very clear and as good as a quality FM radio with no hollow sound in the earpiece which is a real plus. The quality of the metallic like dialing buttons is great and has easy to see large glowing blue numbers that are recessed slightly inside the metal keys.  No signs of button wear after 5 years of use. This phone has a strong hinge. A total leather Made in America case is still available from Amazon for this phone which will protect it completely from damage in a 6 foot fall and allow the user not to remove it from it's case when making or receiving a phone call. Plus the phone is very nice looking IMO.  There are newer phones out there complete with bells and whistles but I will stay with this phone as long as I can.",3/17/14,1

165979,Just The Right Size â€“ Many excellent features in a low cost phone - Detailed Review,Daisy S Daisy S,RJAX1VNFAKKB6,"For the low price of just under 200 dollars this is an excellent phone! Personally, I love to upgrade to a new phone once a year and this is my brand new upgrade from my S3 Mini, which also has a 4 inch screen. In the past, I owned BIG SCREEN PHONES as Galaxy Note (with 5.3 screen, too heavy and too big) and wanted something smaller that I could hold in one hand comfortably. After researching this phone before I purchased it, I liked the features all but two things and found ways to work around each! Below are big concerns and how I fixed them!1) The first thing is the low internal FIXED memory, which Samsung lists as 4 GB. This is low and this is the size BEFORE they added the OS and the Touch Wiz to run the phone.So I ended up with INTERNAL MEMORY of 2.15 GB left in which to add my apps. This is no problem I found because I did not install any games or too many apps. Just the helpful and essential MUST have apps from the Playstore. Great news! After I finished adding about 10 apps, I still have close to 2GB left to add more apps in the future!2) Camera has 5MP and this is do-able. At first, I was concerned about this, but found it is not a problem if I take a picture in good lighting or outside. It does have flash on the camera, so this does help. So I took pictures inside and outside and took a look and they looked clear! My goal in this review is to help in your buying decision one way or the other regarding this phone.Tips using this phoneâ€™s camera for CLEAR PICTURES every time: Hold it steady, wait about 3 seconds for the phoneâ€™s camera to focus, then take the picture, and use flash indoors.PROS:+ SIZE AND WEIGHT: Perfect size for me as it fits easily into my jeans pocket or smallest purse. And I purchased a leather vertical case that clips to my waistband so I take it with me to the gym to listen to my music or radio when I work out. Since the 4 inch screen and smaller phone is sleeker and also lighter, it fits anywhereâ€”no more heavy and bulky phone to drag around.+ MICRO SIM CARD: A couple of months ago I bought a Sim Cutter from Amazon. Glad that I did as I cut my old standard sized Sim card from my old S3 Mini, popped it into the Sim slot and the phone works great! (I could have taken it to my local phone store and bought a new Micro Sim and let them transfer the data to it, but no need). These days, the new phones are going to Micro Sim cards and some new phones (including iPhone 5) will be going to the tiny Nano Sim.+ Phone call clarity etc. - No matter what my location using this phone for phone calls the clarity of calls is loud and clear whether on the phone's speaker, headset etc. I even had to turn down the volume quite a lot as the calls come in so well.+ WiFi/3G (Internet): Connects to any WiFi I have tried very quickly and easily and the signal strength is excellent even when I am far from my router. And when not near a WiFi hotspot, I use AT&T; for data and easily get 3G and found the data to be very fast, almost as fast as my home WiFi is. (For browser, I installed Opera Mini free from Playstore and found it to be a very easy to use and fast browser). Be sure that on the WiFi settings, Advanced that you keep the WiFi on always and to not have the WiFi turn off when the phone is sleeping (or the screen turns off)â€”this way the WiFi will stay on until you turn it off. Be sure to remember to turn off WiFi when you finish to save battery!+ Overall speed, performance, smoothness, picture quality of the screen--very fast and peppy. And I found a way to SAVE on both memory and on battery. What I did was to go into Apps/ Manage Apps and DISABLED the apps I don't use. Without rooting the phone, you cannot uninstall pre-installed factory apps, but you can disable them. Disabling the ones you don't use makes the phone run faster and frees more memory! Since I am a techie, I know which ones to disable and which ones not to disable, so if in doubt, please ask me in the comments and I will be glad to assist you in this.+ BATTERY LIFE: This phone has decent battery life, it is not the best, but the battery is not that large in the phone. I still get all day from the battery IF I turn off the WiFi when not in use and close up apps I do not use. And I use 100% brightness. For me, even at 100 brightness.*To save memory and battery life, I wrote an article on how to turn off apps not needed. Let me know if you need this and ask in the comments.**Apps â€“ I keep my Apps from the Playstore down to 12 MUST HAVE FREE APPS FROM THE PLAYSTORE, and all are pretty small and do not take up much room on this phone nor use much battery. Let me know if you want that list.+ EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD - This helped to sell me on this phone as I can add my personal music, photos, videos and more to this phone!And I placed a 32g in mine for music, files etc. *Keep in mind where External SD cards are concerned: They are JUST for your personal files: music, videos, photos, and other files. When you install apps from Playstore or other sources, they store either in INTERNAL Memory Card or sometimes in the phone area (most store in the INTERNAL SD AREA). This is the law of the land where Android is concerned and ALL newer Android devices (including Samsung) work this way when storing your downloaded apps are concerned.+ INTERNAL STORAGE SPACE (it is small but do-able):This phone is advertised at 4GB of Internal space. The 4GB is the space BEFORE the drive was formatted, OS installed and then factory apps installed. So what I had on the phone BEFORE I installed any apps it had 2.15 GB left. This is how it is on any flash drive, SD card, Hard Drive as formatting alone takes up space.Also, since 3.0 Android and above, you cannot save any apps to your personal SD card. Instead the apps are installed one way or the other to the INTERNAL SPACE. However, the good thing is that your personal files as photos, music, videos, and more can be installed to your EXTERNAL SD Card so you do have that space for yourself.**I have a few apps I downloaded from the Playstore, but no games so I still have about 4.08 GB left on my phone for more apps later should I wish to install them.+ CAMERA - The 5MP camera concerned me that is UNTIL I took both indoor and outdoor pictures and even video. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. When I printed out some close up and other shots, I was really happy with the detailing in the pictures. And it compared to the picture quality I had with my Samsung Galaxy with 8MP camera, so what a happy surprise! Turns out to be a pretty good camera.+ Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.CONS:- Adobe Flash is not supported in this phone or ANY ANDROID DEVICE after 4.0 OS. The only way to get flash is to get a archived flash and use a high end browser such as Puffin or Maxthon Browser. So downloading the older archived flash gives the ability to view SOME internet videos, but this is better than no flash at all. Keep in mind this is a problem with ALL brands of Android devices with 4.0 OS and higher it is just after 4.0 Android came out, the NEW and best flash is NOT supported for Android devices. It is what it is...- Very small instruction manual provided with the tablet, however, I went to the Samsung site and downloaded the full manual and saved it in PDF on my laptop for reading anytime I need it. If you want the link for the manual, let you know in the comments and I will give it to you.- This phone will NOT accept an OTG (On the go) USB plug for flash drives, mice, etc. This was not a problem for me, I just plug in the USB Cable to copy files to the phone. So no big deal.-- International Phone so NO US WARRANTY. Not a problem for me because I have learned over time that if a device is going to fail, it usually does it within the first 30 days. This phone has been great--no problems at all!-- No NFC except on the LTE model. I do not use NFC so I have no problem with that.Bottom line: Would I buy this phone all over again? Yes I certainly would. Will this phone be the best for you? Yes, if you do not expect every bell and whistle feature from the bigger phones such as S4 and S5 etc, want just the most important features, want a smaller and more lightweight phone that will do all the basic things of a Smartphone, then I totally recommend this phone!Hope this review has assisted you and thank you for reading it. Please feel free to ask me any questions in the comment area and I will answer all questions in a very timely manner.",3/11/14,1

I can use this phone easily with one hand, but I have big hands in general. If your only issue with this phone is its size, GET IT. You easily get used to the size and don't even notice it (however i wouldnt recommend to individuals with tiny hands).  Comment with any other questions ill try to get back as quick as I can.Bought this phone off amazon in january (2 months ago) due to its amazing deal and reduced price and I am not at all dissatisfied. Worth noting, I purchased this phone over the LG G2. I do have a single significant complaint on this phone regarding the charger, scroll to the bottom for that.Design:The layout and physical features of this phone are fantastic. While it may not be encased in a solid block of metal, you never feel like your holding a cheap phone. The materials are very sturdy and well made, especially when one utilizes a case. In my opinion, being able to access the battery, sim, microSD in the back of the phone is more useful than it being in a solid metal body.  The phone itself is incredibly thin. I purchased a Spigen slim hardcase for the phone because I wanted to keep the phone sleek and thin as designed. Button placement is very intuitive and easy to get used too.Hardware:This phone is fast. All the benchmark tests do not lie. This thing performs better than any phone i've had and is faster than my 1st gen Samsung Galaxy Tab. I like to get the most out of my phones, to the point of unlocking them, but even with all of the pre-loaded bloat-apps this thing still flys. Great on WiFi or LTE. Screen is amazingly clear, with great contrast and color. Buttons are firm and don't feel like they're going to break. The speakers are good, not great. They get the job done for most users watching youtube or listening to music occasionally. If you're a hardcore music lover and sound quality is a top priority, you may want to look elsewhere. Touch screen sensitivity is great out of the box. I've had no issues.UI and software:If you've ever used an andriod or samsung device before, you'll quickly find yourself comfortable with this phone. If you've never used it before, it is easy and very enjoyable. I always recommend it over iOS, But I don't have enough experience with Windows to sway you from it. But the User Interface is intuitive and for the most part can be understood by most. There are so many customization's. From different widgets, layouts, screens, you have so many options to satisfy the most eclectic or OCD personalities.Camera:So many phones have crazy camera features or settings, while the average user wont notice or use half of them. I will say, the picture quality and useful features on this phone can be handy. From action shots to selfies to posting your lunch to instragram  this phone with suffice for most! I always say if you want to really take meaningful pictures, buy a DSLR!Size:The size of this phone always seems to be the sticky issue with people. As I mentioned before, if size is the only issue holding you back from this phone, JUST GET IT. 99% of your wont be disappointed, and will quickly get used to the phone. Depending on your size, it will be easier than others. The average male wouldn't have a problem with it in his pocket. For reference I am about 6 foot and average build with larger hands. I'm always amazed how often I don't even feel it. However, for smaller individuals it may be an issue. My honest opinion is find one in person. I went to BestBuy and the Samsung rep allowed me to hold his work Note3.  I was able to get a real sense of size and feel of it in my pocket, and not just attached to a display table. I love having a larger screen, it just makes it that much easier to use and enjoy, and to me outweighs any size inconvenience.Battery Life:It's amazing. The big size means samsung is able to throw a big battery in it. So even though the larger screen uses more power, many average users wont have a problem going an entire day on one charge. on average i get about a day and a half. If i use heavy (constant screen on) for several hours straight, then i'll run the battery down in a day. But idle in your pocket with LTE on all day. You'll have no issues. The USB 3.0 charger/port is fantastic. This thing charges so fast. I can get a full charge in half the time as my old HTC Thunderbolt. People complain about the thickness of the cord, but its required for the phone to charge that fast, safely. Which brings me to my only issue i've had with this phone...My only complaint:I had a few issues charging my phone. At first I was extremely upset as I thought the port inside my phone was defective. Essentially, with the USB 3.0 cord and charger, you get 2 connections in one. The standard USB port, and an extra smaller port which is why your able to achieve such fast charging and data transfers. My issue was that one of the 2 connections on the USB3 wasn't getting a solid contact in my phone. This lead to longer charge times and my phone telling me Please use the original charger that came with your phone for faster charging. I simply bought a new cord on amazon and i haven't had any problems since. I recommend to anyone having charging issues to first try another cord, as my issue was that the connection to the phone on the cord, was slightly bent.On the other side, its worth noting you CAN indeed charge this phone with regular phone micro USB cords, however it will be slow.Overall, JUST GET THIS PHONE. I can't state it enough, it is really a fantastic phone. I fought back and forth whether to get this or the LG G2 for cheaper, but I decided I wanted the best phone I could buy (at ~$250 for the best phone on the market? that's fairly priced) and would last me a long time, and more importantly keep me preoccupied, and not wanting to buy a new phone before my upgrade.",3/27/14,1
175141,Moto G Delivers What It Promises For A Reasonable Price,L. Lavender,R3MRBM9IZ8KTZ6,"I upgraded to the Moto G from a LG Optimus Logic for use with Straight Talk. I got the required micro SIM card and had no problems activating. Transferring contacts, photos, personal ringtones, etc. was easy and painless with Motorola Migrate.I would have preferred an SD slot, but knew coming in that it didn't come with one. I generally don't take many photos or videos with my phone or store them on my device (not with all the cloud devices available for storage) or use my phone as a media player, so it was a non-issue. I went with the 8GB since I only wanted room for some useful apps and tools (no games or 'toys') and find I have had plenty of room.My area does not have 4G LTE... yet, so again, a non-issue for me.I was looking for a device to use for everyday and basic essential needs and tasks, not necessarily a lot of gimmicky buzzers & bells, and this Moto G delivers what I wanted and expected.",3/9/14,1

183328,An excellent budget smartphone,Oliver C.,R35RUSPJINXQYV,"If you're looking for a budget smartphone below $200, look no further.  Kingelon N8800 fits the bill.  This is an excellent budget smartphone that works like a premium smartphone.  The specs as listed are correct.Phone features:Phone calling works well, I can hear the other party, and I can be heard loud and clear from the other side.This phone has two sims.  The first sim is regular size sim, and supports both 3G and 2G. 3G has 850 and 2100 mhz bands, 2G supports 850, 900, 1800, and 1900 mhz bands.  The second sim is a smaller sized mini sim, and supports 2G only (850/900/1800/1900 mhz).  For this phone, I use AirVoice wireless service, a MVNO of AT&T;, and 3G data works quite well.Performance - This phone is fast, since it has the MTK6592 eight-core processor.  It can run almost all of the apps that I installed on it.  I ran Antutu benchmark and it scored 26,800.  I would think this phone can also handle games as well.Display - the display is amoled that is visible/readable even at oblique angles.  The resolution though is only QHD - 540x960.Battery - the battery is a huge 3400 mah, but with it's octa-core CPU, the battery drain is subtantial while running cpu intensive apps.  I use greenify for hibernating apps, and this really reduces the battery usage to a bare minimum when the phone is idle.WIFI - this phone's wifi is dual-band, it can detect 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz wifi signals from routers.Sensors - It has only accelerometer, light sensor, proximity sensor, and microphone.  No magnetic sensor (compass would not work), no NFC.GPS - gps works fine, and can get a satellite fix in less than a minute from a cold-start.Storage and RAM.  This phone has 1 GB RAM, which for me is enough for running the usual apps.  Internal storage is listed at 8 GB, and for which about 5.5 GB is actually usable, and the operating system uses about more than 2 GB.  O/S is Android JB 4.2.2.  It has an external micro SD slot.  The specs states that it can use a 32 GB micro sdhc.  I tried a 64 GB micro SDXC and it works fine.Overall, this is an excellent value for the money.",3/31/14,1
92459,Great buy. Keeping Cellular Communication Simple.,surpie1940,R1WD6G4IUOWGL5,"It works and appears to be  NSIB, although it is not describe as such. Nothing like a flipback for simplicity.",3/9/14,1
147665,Awesome,joshua3106 jay,RPOZ7RSVJ78WT,"but listen carefully to those comments regarding the teeny tiny memory on this smartphone ... unless you are ready to root and figure out how to partition correctly, be prepared for some frustration",3/31/14,1
176780,Great phone for great price,wootwootwoot,R8QQ2OM9MMQC0,"I needed an inexpensive unlocked phone. This was the perfect choice. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles as the more expensive flagship phones but it does its job very well. It runs very smooth and all of my apps run fine on it. The only time it gets jerky is when I have six or seven things going at once, but usually that's a result of me forgetting to close out unused apps. It has wifi, bluetooth, a nice speaker for speakerphone, audio quality is clear for both incoming calls and outgoing calls (my wife has one as well and I hear her well when we speak). The screen is clear and responsive. It feels sturdy and well built.One thing I really love about this is that it comes with Quick Office. So I can make spreadsheets and word documents on the go. I usually track my expenses on my phone throughout the week until I have time to update my budget at home. The spreadsheet software has many basic and even some more advanced functions for people who like spreadsheets.The only thing I wish it had was voice control. It's difficult to call people when I'm driving because I have to search their name in the phone book via typing or use the voice search which works moderately well with names. This is not a huge deterrent to the phone but rather a better deterrent of me not paying attention to the road.The camera is not for photograph enthusiasts as it takes only mediocre quality pictures but it's good enough to just have a snapshot of the moment or to share on Facebook.All the complaints I have about the phone is something that can be resolved by buying a more expensive phone. But given my applications, it's not worth it to pay the extra $300-$400 for a more expensive phone that makes my life just a hair more convenient.Also did I mention that the battery lasts for over a day? From start to finish my battery has lasted up to 30 hours. That was with light to moderate use. I sent text messages the majority of the time, talked for maybe an hour, and used the internet for a couple hours at home and a couple youtube videos.Great phone. Huge bang for the buck. I would highly recommend it to anyone who's not a tech enthusiast but wants a smart phone for every day use.",3/11/14,1

179680,Awesome!,David E Farris,R8XL4ZK5G37F0,"Bought this for my mom who is in a nursing home, she has never had a smartphone before. I wanted something that would be a great source of entertainment, and functional. It has lived up to my expectations! It was delivered very fast, and the price for what you get is amazing.  I purchased a samsung phablet for myself and payed twice as much. The touch screen is very responsive,no lag in apps. The sound that comes from the speaker is really really loud. Which is great for someone that is hard of hearing. I signed her Up for Walmart family mobile plan popped in the sim card and it was up and running. Phone calls are very clear no echo. It came with two battery's and a screen protector that was already installed. Also came with a case that doubles as a back for the phone. Not the most deluxe but serves it's purpose. Hoping to find a trident type case that with fit. The device it's self is attractive very thin and light.  I got the pink model and the nurses at the nursing home ooh and aah over the color.

183491,Arguably the best ONE,WiseShopper,R32BCT0NYLE1ZI,"You are probably interested in buying a new phone but having a hard time choosing the right phone because of all the choices that are out there. After researching the best phones that are available or soon to be available (HTC One M8 and the Samsung S5) for weeks, I pulled the trigger on the M8 and picked one up when it was released to Verizon. The LG G3 is too far away to be considered. I can't tell you how awesome this phone is without writing 10 pages but I will try to keep it short and straight to the point. I hope this review helps you decide if this is the phone for you and why this is the best overall phone available right now. Honestly do not get the S5, because you will regret it. If you want a plastic phone that is powerful and probably the best in the Spec department, just wait for the LG G3. It is coming near the summer of this year and it will have amazing performance and the best display. It will probably outperform all phones including M8, but I will be happy with my HTC M8 because there isn't or will be any better looking phone that also has competitive specs this year.Why and who should get this phone?People who want a phone that:-Is well crafted and probably the most beautiful phone ever made (yes better design and materials than iPhone)-is one of the fastest phone currently available-Can live without having the best camera-Simply works without buggy software crashing and want a smooth android experience-Is one of the best phones available this year-Is a solid phone that is 90% metal and feels elegant to hold in your hand-Has very good battery life (not the best) but most people will be satisfied-Makes other people wish they had a sexy phone like it, even iPhone users-Has many cool features like motion launch, dual camera, step counter, IR blaster to be used as a remote for TVs and more, double tap to wake up, few other tricks that make it fun and easy to useWho should buy something else?People who want a phone that:-Is an iPhone (Apple lovers)-Is a Windows Phone (Microsoft lovers)-Is slightly faster but mostly plastic-Has an amazing camera and loves taking highest quality pictures with a phone-Has the best battery life and does not have a car charger-Is ugly with amazing performance and unnecessary specs.Skip this paragraph if you don't care to know what type of person is giving you this information:It is very difficult to choose a phone today because of all the choices that are available. But I finally found the ONE without compromising much. I want to give a little background about myself before you think I am just an average smart phone user. Like many of you I always want the hottest gadgets and especially the best phone. I honestly love iPhone's design but I hate their software and that is why I have always used Android phones. A few of my previous phones include: HTC EVO 3D, Galaxy S3, Droid DNA, Galaxy S4. I also had the Nokia Lumia for a very short period of time and I was not impressed by the phone or the Windows software. The only reason I did not get the original One (M7) is because of the lack of microSD slot.HERE I WILL LIST THE POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES OF THE PHONE WITH RATING COMPARED TO OTHER PHONES THAT ARE AVAILABLE OR WILL BE SOON:Overall Rating 9.6/10Positives:Design 10/10 : Arguably the most well designed phone available right nowPerformance 10/10 : One of the, if not the fastest phone currentlyDisplay 9/10 : Easily the top 3 displayExtra Features 9/10 : Missing few extras (fingerprint, heart rate monitor) but it has other features that makes up for it.Storage 10/10: Finally a microSD slot that supports up to 128GB and it has a 32GB model.Software 9.5/10: HTC Sense UI is the closest OEM software that is as awsome as the stock Android UI, I personally like the HTC sense more, it is smooth and not buggy like the Samsung TouchWiz. It has useful apps such as: BlinkFeed, Sense TV, and FitBit can be downloaded serperately and the sensors provide very acurate step counts.Negatives:Battery 8.5/10 : The battery life is above average but could have been a little better. Overall it's better than 92% of other phones. Not bad at all. A new update called Extreme Power Saving is soon to be released and it will help save a lot of battery when you turn it on, almost 70% increase. It basically turns off useless services and will probably increase the rating to 9/10.Camera 8/10 : Kind of disappointed because so many other phones have better cameras (iPhone 5s, Galaxy S4, LG G2, etc). There was no upgrade to the camera from the previous model. But I give it a 8 because the camera is decent and it has other interesting features that make up for the slightly low resulution. The camera is not bad by any means, its just not excellent. It is the first phone with dual camera and it can do some breathtaking and useful trick to the pictures using the depth information captured by the second camera. Overall I am happy with the camera.As you can see the phone is just too good to have extreme negatives, the negatives are just slightly below what is expected of a smartphone in my opinionBelow are more specific details of the phone, read if you pleaseDesign 10/10: This is the best looking phone in the world right now and that's a fairly accurate statement. Some might disagree but not many. The pictures does not do enough justice, it is truly gorgeous to look at and to hold. It feels like holding a metal artwork. It feels very solid and premium in my hands. I am only 5'3 and I have fairly small hands and I honestly think it is the perfect size, maybe 5% longer than I hoped for. Overall it's hard to find a well-crafted and more beautiful phone than the HTC M8, yes it is more elegant than the iPhone. Don't worry it is not all about design, it packs some serious power.Performance 10/10 : Let's just say it is the fastest phone available right now according to the benchmark tests I have done. The phone is amazingly smooth, everything just opens up instantly. I have not experienced one bit of lag or any errors. The Sense UI is closest as you can get to the stock Android UI experience with any OEM UI. The Samsung Touchwiz and LG UI is a mess compared to the Sense. The Qualcomm 801 processor is a fast and efficient processor. I can almost guarantee you that performance will not disappoint you.Display 9/10: The phone gorgeous inside out. The picture quality is extremely sharp and vibrant. It is easily top 3 in the graphic department. It is very bright and crystal clear. But there are a few phones currently out that outperform the display. My brother's LG G2 has a slightly better display. I hoped for it to be number one in this department but overall its nothing to complain about.Battery 8.5/10: With all the advances in technology I am not sure why there has been such little innovation in the battery field. It is not just cell phone batteries but all batteries in general. Some manufacture like Motorola has done decent job with providing large batteries in recent years. HTC has always disappointed me in this department and this phone is no exception. But I have to admit it is above average and I am fairly satisfied so far. I am able to go through an entire day without a problem. My day starts at 6 and ends at 7. My normal usage include: Frequent texting, 1-2 hours of talking, 3-4 hours of surfing and email, 30-45 minutes of games and the rest standby. I am able to get through the entire day but honestly most of us have chargers at work and in our cars. So overall I am not too obsessed over battery but the M8 does provide fairly decent battery life. Most of the tests reported a full day of normal to somewhat heavy use and I can confirm that. It was supposed to come with a setting called Extreme Power Saver but apparently it will be provided soon with an update. It supposed to limit the phone to only email, phone, text and few other basic things to save a lot of battery. Supposably up to 70% more battery. I can't comment on it until I receive the update.Extras 9/10: What's a flagship phone without some tricks? The M8 has some cool tricks up its sleeve.Camera Affects: I will complain about the camera quality later but let me state the positives in this section. Basically the camera has some tricks that help me deal with the moderate quality of the images. My brother has a$1200 DSLR camera that he uses to take cool pictures and I can do the same now with my $600 new phone. My favorite feature is the U-Focus which blurs the background and focuses on the object, like your face. Obviously the DSLR camera does an exceptional job but most people can't tell the difference with the first glance. The second camera on the device captures depth information and you can add cool affects to the pictures after you take it using that information. There few other ones like Sketch and Cartoon and Zoom effect but I find the U-Focus to be the most interesting one. But most people will use all of them because they work very well and are very easy to customize a picture.Motion/Sensors Stuff: My favorite trick is double tapping the screen to wake it up and turn it off. It's amazing how this simple feature can be so useful. I hated pressing the power button to turn on the display and now all I have to do is tap the screen. I can also swipe from the bottom to top in order to unlock the device and go to the last app I had open. You don't have to go to the lock screen, you can directly go to the home screen if you don't have a passcode setup. Swiping from right to left take you to the awesome BlinkFeed screen. Swiping from top to bottom brings up google now (voice command). Swipping from right to left take you to the home screen. The final motion trick is answering the phone by simply lifting the phone to your ear. Thre is also a feature where you hold the phone in landscape orientation and press the volume up to activate the camera app.FitBit App: The phone has a built in barometer and bunch of other sensors that can track your steps very accurately. Most phones have some of the sensors but only the iPhone and Nexus 5 has all the sensors like the M8. As a result the M8 and the few other phones can track your steps very accurately without buying a pedometer like the FitBit Flex or Force. The FitBit app was supposed to come preinstalled but you can easily download it from the play store for free. I am currently using it to track my steps and its about 96% accurate.Remote for TV and more: The M8 has an IR Blaster built in, you can control all your electronics with your phone. HTC has this app called Sense TV, it's very interesting and useful. You basically select your cable provider and select the channels you have and the app gives you show times and what's currently playing based on your favorite stations and shows. Basically it's a smart guide on your phone and you simply click on the show and your cable box will bring up the show. The setup is easy, you simply select your cable box model, TV model, home theater model and you can control all of them using your phone. But I highly recommend getting this app called IR Smart Remote, it's about $6 and it is the best remote app for your phone. You can basically throw away all your remotes and use your phone to control everything; it does a very similar job as the Harmony remotes. Do some research on it, you may like this app.Camera 8/10: Compared to all the other phones available, I am very disappointed at with the picture and video quality of the main camera. It is the same exact camera as the previous model except it has an extra camera. The picture quality is not bad but it is not excellent like many other phones. The main problem is the lack of resolution and bright light pictures. If there is too much light, for example capturing the sky in a sunny day might be hard; the picture doesn't capture blue sky properly. Overall it's a decent camera but I was expecting more. It is an average and maybe slightly below average camera.Final Verdict: If you want a beautiful, fast, elegant and a phone that simply works, then just get this phone as soon as you can. I know many people are comparing the Galaxy S5 and honestly the S5 has several advantages but the HTC One M8 is the clear winner to me. If you don't mind the plastic and somewhat of a bland look, then get the S5. If you want the most elegant phone that is available, then get the M8.",3/27/14,1

161949,Love this phone,Attila Csanyi,R2O9Y2R3VFCHXB,"I have been searching for a good phone ~ tablet. This is it. Has all the LTE bands (except for AT&T;). IT IS WATERPROOF. I dropped it in the tub. Aside from the mini heart attack, the phone survived.Lots of people complain the camera. It is ok, but not the greatest. I took all my roadtrip photos off this camera. Most, and I mean 99% turned out wonderful.I can not wait for the Xperia Z Ultra 2 to come to market. Will wait few months after release and get it for $450'sh $500'sh rather than $750 like the latest Samsung Phablets.",3/24/14,1
145382,awesome buy,Patrick G.,R26MY19GK7JLE5,"I can't really comment on all the technical aspects or do a comparison between this and a much more expensive brand, because I could never afford to spend $600 on a phone. I will share with you though that if you are looking for a great smart phone at a great price, this is the one. I purchased directly from amazon for the peace of mind. You truly can never go wrong with a company that understands customer service as well as they do. The package includes a case, screen protector, ear buds and of course a charger. If you ask me, the picture on this is amazing and everything works exactly as it should. Calls are very clear and audible. It locks onto GPS without a hiccup and seems to pickup WiFi hotspots almost as soon as they become available making for an even faster experience. I have net10 service, just pop your Sim card in and you are set to go. I personally did not have to alter any APN settings in order for everything to work flawlessly. If you find yourself reading the reviews of this and you are on the fence about it, I would highly recommend purchasing. It is an awesome phone for everyday use. The rear facing camera is pretty good provided the lighting is correct, low light pictures do appear a bit grainy. The camera is beyond sufficient for my purposes but others may place a higher value on this.",3/12/14,1

155325,Great smart phone for the cost,buyer 1,ROJY3QFT69KP8,"The Avail is a great way to get the convenience of a smart phone without paying a lot of money.  It has all of the other features that most of the high dollar phones have at a fraction of the cost.  The wall charger acts as both an AC charger and as a usb cord, which is nice as I personally have not found too many of the less expensive phones that have that feature.  It is thin phone that even with a case fits nicely in a shirt pocket or purse and it not too long, yet the touch screen is the perfect size.  It is also very durable for those of us who have members in our household that seem to be very rough on cell phones.  I definitely recommend this phone to others.",3/15/14,1

Signal strength is great.  Screen looks nice and apps work well.  Camera is not the best but better than some other phones.

After having several high end smart phones, I just re-purchased it again.  Mainly because of Microsoft windows and price, and because everything works so well and simple.  Good battery life, nice clear screen and can hear conversations nice and clear too but most importantly, it has WiFi calling which most phones don't offer it with T-Mobile.  Although I have several android tablets, IPad, and windows tablet, I always seem to like the Windows program better except for the lack of apps. I recommend this phone.",3/24/14,1
163671,Couldn't be happier,Ashley Durham,R3TEKWJSS753QM,"I love this phone. I thought I would have issues with how big the screen is, but once you start using it everything else seems small by comparison. The applications run lightning fast and the functionality is mind-blowing. You can really customize it to do and be anything you want. I feel like I got a great deal buying through Amazon, even at the Sprint store they were charging at least $200 for this model. I seriously feel like I have a tiny laptop or tablet with all the power they packed into this phone.The only downsides are the fragility of the phone (looks one unfortunate drop away from being a paperweight), the pre-installed bloatware apps (some are useful and some not, but it comes with A TON), and the battery life (I'm usually around 20% at the end of my work day). In this case, though, the awesome power and coolness of the phone make it more than worth it.",3/26/14,1

130065,"Great phone, no complaints",Jeremy Korzeniewski,R25AI783DM1QR1,"This is a great phone. The Windows Phone operating system is very simple to use, and the app store is filling out nicely.

180957,A great upgrade from my iPhone 5,John S. Dean John,R1IZ7SANODQI9G,"I've been waiting for this phone for a long time.  I got tired of Apple's 50 shades of grey upgrade in IOS7, and so had my Verizon rep for my corporate account send me the Lumia 928 back in September of 2013.  I loved it, and would've ordered one right there until I saw a leaked photo and some tentative specs of the Lumia 929 that was to be released in a couple months.  I decided to wait, since the improvements over the 928 were many.I almost lost patience in November, December, and January when all the rumored release dates passed, but I'm glad I waited.  My rep was able to overnight one to me so I had it on release day.  I gave my old iPhone 5 to one of my employees and never looked back.This is a VERY nice phone in all respects.  In every way I compare it to my iPhone 5, it wins.  The only downside is the thin choice of apps still in the Microsoft store, but that's improving.  The iPhone and Samsung phones started out the same way.  The only things I really miss from the iPhone are a few apps, not the phone itself, since I have a lot of home automation, and there is, as yet, no Windows phone options for my Logitech security cameras, my Ecobee thermostat, and a few of my power switch modules.But apps aside, from a hardware perspective, this is a clear win.  The full 1920x1080 screen is gorgeous to view.  Even in sunlight I can see what I need to see.  I was a little worried about the size for two reasons - first, I didn't want something that was awkward to hold.  I've seen people with the phablet devices and I just can't picture lugging something like that around as a PHONE - may as well use my retina iPad mini...  But I also just bought a new 2014 Jeep Cherokee Limited, and the technology package in it has a special upper section of the arm rest that includes a Qi charging plate and a little sliding holder to keep the phone there.  I really hoped this would fit in there ,and it did, even with a case on.  Snug, but it works great.  And the increase in resolution over the 928 means that there's more tiles I can fit on the main screen.And for me, that's where the iPhone loses compared to Windows.  I never cared much for the lock screen's lack of information, which was why I invariable jailbroke my iPhones.  And the limited options for the screens when the phone was unlocked made it annoying to have to dig into folders to find what I was looking for, or swipe the screen.  I was very happy when they made folders an option, so you didn't have 20 or 30 pages of icons, but it still was annoying sometimes.  I like that with Windows I can resize the icons and fit  lot of things that I use daily on a single screen.  I also love the live tile implementation of things, so I can see at a glance what's been happening without having to rely on a notification center type of screen.It's easy to hold, since in reality it isn't THAT much larger than the iPhone 5 was.  The buttons are easy to get at and responsive.  I like that they changed the USB port to the bottom, since the 928 had it on the top and that just drove me bonkers during my week of testing.  The sound is quite good for such a small device.The processor is snappy, which makes sense since it's the quad core snapdragon processor.  There's little to no waiting for pretty much anything I open on here.  Graphics are incredible and smooth for the few games I've put on here so far.  Zooming photos or the camera is also very smooth.And the camera - it's amazing.  I have several higher end digital cameras, and an awesome $1600 Sony camcorder, but the photos this turns out are more than acceptable to me.  It used to be I'd settle for photos with my iPhone due to convenience, when I didn't want to lug my large camera case around with the cameras and lenses for some event.  And yes, if I really want to capture something to the best of my ability, I'll use my real photo equipment.  However, for the other 95% of the time, I'll be more than happy to use my phone now and not have to carry anything else out.  The options are easy to get at, white balance, ISO, flash, so many more options that with the iPhone...  And the single finger zoom, rather than the pinch, or the slider at the one spot on the iPhone, makes bracketing my pictures so much easier.  I find I can get just the shot I want so much easier with this than I could with the iPhone, and the quality, needless to say, just doesn't compare.  The 20 mp camera here and the optics used make you think that there was no way this photo could've been taken by a phone.We have a client in a medical building that's on the lower floor, and in their server room, we NEVER have gotten a signal with any phone from any carrier.  And yesterday I was able to receive a phone call in there, and hear and be heard.  That was a first for our company in that site.  Another pleasure for the phone is being able to hit END and have it end the call.  I've spent most of my time after the IOS 7 update on my iPhone being unable to end a call myself, it would not respond to me pressing END no matter how many times I tried.  Phone calls would only end when the other side hung up and my phone realized it.I love the built in Qi charger.  I had a Duracell case for my iPhone and another extended battery that charged on a proprietary pad, and had gotten used to that method of charging.  So I bought two charging pads, one for the office, one for home.  I've gone through three cases so far trying to find a good one, and the charging on the pads and even in my Jeep works through the cases just fine.  It's a convenience that you don't realize you'd use until you get accustomed to it.  No plugs, no cables, just set the phone down and the charging begins, with no special case required like the iPhone.  The back gets a little warm, but I've never felt it get hot no matter how long I had it placed on the charger.This has quite a large battery in it, and initially I thought it'd last longer than the iPhone, but the downside to the live tiles is battery consumption.  With little talking and little game playing, it runs down quicker than you'd think.  I went from 100% at 7 AM at a client site to about 40% left after 8 hours. There's a lot of forum posts out there about things you can do to lessen the impact, but for me I'd rather deal with the battery consumption and have all my data, since this is first and foremost a business tool for me.  Each mail account has its own live tile so I can see at a glance what the status is of new messages for my own Exchange server, or Gmail, or my Windows Live account.  I'm not much of a facebook user but it's there as well, keeping me updated on info for my family.  All of this visible without opening any programs up.  For me, that convenience makes up for the battery being used quicker.Another bonus for me is with my Jeep.  I have the large Uconnect system, that can let you do voice texting over the stereo system.  This never worked with my iPhone, but it works fine with the Icon.  It reads me a text, and I can voice back what my reply is, and the car will repeat what I said and give me the opportunity to accept what it heard, or change it.  Very handy since I don't pull up the phone to send or receive texts and such while driving.  Another thing I don't use much, but it's nice to have when I need to.For me, the lack of an expansion slot for an SD card or something isn't an issue.  I have a Lenovo Helix tablet / laptop that I use for all my data.  I pull photos to it from my Onedrive (used to be Microsoft's Skydrive) so I really don't have a need for extra storage on the phone.  But for some people who use a phone as their center of their digital existence, it will be a major issue.  So if you absolutely must have additional storage on the device, this may not be for you.  But with the the seamless cloud storage integration, I don't think it's that critical for a lot of people.And I like that I have such a viable option for Microsoft Office documents here, that I can open a Word document from my Onedrive and it looks like I expect it to, and that I can edit it and then have the results later on my computer when I'm back at the office.All in all, I'm 100% happy with the hardware, just a little impatient with developers of the programs I need for home automation to make a Windows Phone variant of their software.  There's nothing I feel I lost in my transition from the iPhone, I've only gained.  For me, this is a much more usable phone in all respects than my iPhones ever were.  And it's a big step from the old Windows Mobile phones back in 2007 and 2008.This is one phone that shows that the Windows Phone platform isn't just a fluke, and it has all the opportunities to flourish.  Of course, that success isn't in Microsoft's hands, but in the hands of the people who write apps.  It doesn't matter how awesome a phone is, if people can't get the things they want or need to run on it, most of them will stick with the platform that they can.  So I really hope the Microsoft store starts fleshing itself out.",3/1/14,1

171506,"A cheap phone, done really, really well.",Gilbert_Sundevil,R396KZYMOZRZQP,"I've been a Palm fan since the old Palm Pilot days and finally gave up on my old Palm Pre 2 a month or so ago.  Consequently, Android OS is a whole new experience for me.  I still am biased to Palm's WebOs, so it's tough for me to give a detailed impartial review of the operating system.  Suffice it to say that the OS is clean, free of bloatware, and has been running smooth as glass for me.On the hardware side, I want to give a big high-five to Motorola and Google for producing such as well made product.  This is a solid piece of equipment.  Buttons work well, touch-screen is responsive, no hiccups from the processor when running programs, etc.  I'm getting used to the screen size having come from a much smaller phone, but after only a few weeks it seems to be just right.  Form factor fits in my average size hands well.  Sound is great from speakers, and earbuds.  If I had to search for a con, it would be that the phone is a little more slippery than my last device.  No drops yet, but I worry.  If this is a concern for you it's a quick fix with the myriad of shell options either directly from motorola or from an after-market manufacturer.I hope this unlocked phone is the first step in the right direction on untangling the hardware from the mobile phone companies, allowing a greater freedom in choice (and lower prices) for consumers.  I highly recommend this phone.",3/14/14,1

This phone has everything you need including a couple of surprise features like facial recognition passwords (that's a hoot). It's super fast and easy to navigate and beautiful. It's solidly built and looks far more expensive than it is. Unfortunately, some unscrupulous brick and mortar store owners are taking advantage of people's lack of knowledge about the price of the phones.

177974,"Seriously good smartphone, seriously low price",NotEnoughTimeToRead,R2S9QQB0JAEHAB,"I've used this phone for several months now, and VERY pleased with it.  I went from HTC Desire HD to this phone, having considered the Galaxy S3 and the HTC One as possible alternatives.This is a nice phone.The spec is on par with the Samsung and HTC offerings, and exceeds them in some respects, mainly the camera.It hasn't been loaded up with a ton of Android customisation, so the Android experience is pretty close to stock.The dual SIM capability is brilliant, especially if you travel out of the country.It's sturdy and the build quality is very good.I have a couple of minor quibbles, but they are minor.1.  There is a screen auto dim built in that dims the screen to 50% after a very short time, like less than 10 seconds.  When reading something on the phone, this can be annoying.  I reached out to the manufacturer on this, and it's not configurable, although they say it may be in future.2.  The power button (right side) and volume rocker (left side) should be offset.  Because of the size, you have to brace against the opposite side when using these buttons, so invariably power off when you meant to adjust volume or adjust volume when you meant to power off.Beyond those, it's perfect.

You would have to go to its website to setup the data service with a new APN.I only have this phone for a day,  got it yesterday (03/18/2014).  I got it one day in advance ( Thank you Amazon for that) and I'd started to play with it right away.**The Best things about this phone (Version D802) is that, it does not come with any pre-loaded and annoying software packages from neither AT&T; nor T-Mobile or any other cell phone company. Thank You God!! So you are not limited by them.  However It does come with some LG applications as expected.You will love that the you can activate the Tethering on this phone since it does not have any limitation from Att or T-Mobile.  I have done it with my Net10 service, but I cannot abuse it otherwise my service will be cancelled by Net10This phone is like a rocket, very fast. Responsiveness is for a person whom want everything for yesterday like me. Again this phone is lightning fast!!.  The phone has a gorgeous and perfect HD screen. The colors are bright and the details are amazing (I'm not going to be too technical about this).Playing Videos (Netflix, Hulu Plus, The CW and more) are play without a hiccup, very smooth like a silk. Going through the movies on Nextflix is not frustrating anymore, you will see the icons almost right away. Now  my internet Service is Comcast 50MB Download, this also can play a difference while using applications that connect to the internet. Your responsiveness might be different.Streaming music via Pandora and Spotify is not a problem either.  Both applications work like charm while streaming.Speaker, i think is the weakest point on this phone. It is an average speaker.  I think LG could have done a better job with the speaker considering that this is a high-end cell phone. But not a big deal for me since a use headphones or my Vizio 5.1 speaker system.**Battery Life is amazing if I compare it with my previous LG G Optimus. The LG G2 with mild (phone call, internet use, chat, audio stream, emails) use from 6:00 to 18:30 I still have 76%. My one-month-old LG G from 6:00-16:00 is with 5-10%. I have not have a heavy use yet, but I will let you know how that goes. This phone also come with an international adapter and a head phone.The 2 taps on the screen to  wake up the phone, I like that. I found out that it is easier that trying to push the power button to wake up your phone.I found out that that it is easier for me to use both the volume and the power button on the back of the phone, since my index finger is right on top of the them while I'm talking.  I do not have to guess where the volume is anymore.I haven't taken my first picture  with the 13mb-camera or use skype yet.This phone has a Guest Mode, like the computers do. If somebody wants to use your phone, just switch it to Guest Mode and that person won't be able to screw up your phone, change anything or look at your personal information.  You can also decide what application(s) that person can use while on Guest Mode. Nice!!! Specially if you have children whom like to play with your phone or watch videos.Being an iPhone user (up to iPhone 5), I can tell that this phone is way better, even better that the iPhone 5s.This is everything for now, I will be back to let you know the rest.  I hope this humble review help you to make a more inform decision and remember that you might have a different experience base on your cell phone company and your internet service provider.",3/19/14,1

With the $35 month for 300 minutes and unlimited text and data and the low price of this phone I have a state of the art 4G smartphone and service for under $500 a year, tell that to your Verizon and ATT friends that spend 3 and 4 times that for the same service.",3/5/14,1

180977,Best phone I've ever owned by far,B. Covington DIY geek,R1PTRDFUWQDH9,"I've owned quite a mixture of phones over the years and this is by far my favorite. I'm a Windows Phone fan already but this hardware is fantastic. The display is amazing - sunlight visibility is great and works better than my previous WP8, the Lumia 810. Photos are incredible and I don't mind keeping the SLR in the bag for quick shots with the images I can capture with the Icon. Videos are great and audio is pretty impressive - normally audio recording levels are off and you get clipping but I haven't had this issue at all with the Icon, even at loud events like the Daytona 500. The only thing missing on this phone is a card slot for additional storage, otherwise it is fantastic and doesn't warrant a reduction in rating since I offload photos and videos regularly. My wife has the same phone as well and, coming from a Galaxy S3 and without exaggerating, tells me every day how much she loves this phone. WP may not have every app available but the core functionality of calls, texting, internet searches, photos/videos, maps/navigation, voice control all work well and faster than anything else I've tried.",3/31/14,1

61703,Recieved more than ever expected!,Arysta Argabright,R216ZI0KC553YE,"It is a pleasant surprise to have received this, let alone any package ordered online, and be completely satisfied. It said fair condition- meaning heavy wear from normal use- and I would have to say it was much better than fair! Barely any blemish on the screen, no physical damage or wear on housing of phone. Battery cover was not broken or worn at all and battery holds a long charge as desired. I am completely satisfied with this purchase and seller and would recommend to everyone.Thanks,your happy customer!",3/31/14,1

133963,Excellent for the price.,Rodney C. Wilson,R2ZHD6DTJ5EFPS,"This phone is not the best I have seen but when you consider the price it is the best Android phone compatible with AT&T; 3G network and unlocked.  Many cheap GSM phones do not support the frequencies used by AT$T.It is elegant looking with nice feel to it. Call quality (even in poor service areas) is excellent.  Good speaker, OK screen, OK camera, great battery life.  Not the fastest but I suspect it is more than enough for the average user.  I tested data speed while tethering this phone to a PC and it clocks at 3.6mbs. That is almost the same as my Samsung 4G that cost 4 times more.  The Bluetooth works much better than other phones I have had with great sound through my car stereo.  I have been using it for a while now streaming internet radio while driving and that also works really well. Just buy it, you will love it if you don't expect it to work like a $400 phone.",3/26/14,1

150692,Nice cheap phone,Marc,R36WAEMLXSUULV,"Performed as advertised. Needed a cheap phone for overseas with a qwerty keyboard for texting. Battery life is great. Phone is very tiny though.

150173,just what I needed!,Mom of 4 boys,R32W0E7RZBVHAL,"I switched to consumer cellular and I wanted a small cell phone that would fit in my pocket, connect to my iPad and macbook calendar and also pick up my email. (I have an iPad and macbook at home with my calendar and set up a gmail account *for the phone calendar* and was able to link them all!)  You just need to enter every event as a gmail event, not an iPad event, or it won't show up on the phone's calendar.  This phone does the trick.  The price was reasonable and the android system is good, even though it is older.  I did have to set up the APN settings in order to get data with a help desk specialist at consumer cellular for  the data to work.  Also, it was doing a little butt dialing until I discovered how to stop it.  Not only do you have to set up a screen lock, BUT ALSO, you need to always hit the HOME button, then the red button before putting it in your pocket.  no more butt dialing or butt texting going on here.  You also need to buy a micro sd card to take pictures and download any games to increase the memory.  Now, we have 3 phones (home, mine and one of my kids) through consumer cellular for $80 per month.  We share 5000 texts, 2000 minutes and 500mb of data.  If my son wants to use a bunch of data at home on his phone, he just turns on the wifi (he bought an unlocked nokia lumia 900 and also had to set up the APN with the help desk at consumer cellular).  great way for me to have a cheap smart phone. If you want the latest and greatest, this is not it :) (the nokia is great though and much cheaper than an iPhone) but I personally do not need an excuse to look at my phone any more, I just need it to communicate and see my calendar!",3/15/14,1
181045,My brother is in awe,Misslillyinthevalley MissAngel,R2BDT3D8UCZ907,I got this phone for my brother. He loves it. He uses it every day. he was fascinated with the dual sim slots lol. He plans to keep t for a long time. It's a good phone.,3/3/14,1

181625,Love this phone!,E. G. Natale tech wannabe,R24IQRV2SPVKP6,I finally took the leap into android territory with this smart phone and I am very pleased. I chose it after reading reviews on Amazon which helped to inform me of ways to work with this phone. I barely use any data choosing instead to use wifi at home and free wifi when available while I'm out. Oh... and I am also loving playing Words with Friends on it!,3/19/14,1
185285,love it,John Owens,R3V3403CXI9NJ,It looks like the I phone and it can fit into one of the original iPhone otter boxes which helps in my line of work. I've had no problems what so ever with this phone I bought 2 of them now.,3/10/14,1

My phone was delivered way before expected took about three days. I had to sign for it which I appreciate as my packages are always left in the hallway.

173174,Very satisfied.,Mihail,RUJPWJNQ66QYW,"Best phone for masses. Battery works just great for one day hard usage - I was able to watch four 1.5 hour movies through WiFi from local NAS and still had about 15% of battery. The same applies to internet browsing. It's possible to recognise screen content under direct sun lights. Screen glass quality is also just perfect - very easy to clean and it's scratch resistant. GPS positioning is very accurate and GPS fix is fast. Camera doesn't work good for objects in motion.No SD card slot inside - looks like the only missing option, I think. After installing offline navigation maps for Europe and North America, after downloading Google Translate with offline dictionaries for 3 languages, after installing every app I need, I'm still having about 5GB of free space inside.I do recommend to buy a case because original phone cover is a bit slippery.",3/13/14,1

144064,Beautiful phone. Better than my note 2,Amazon Customer,R6063HP7NV70R,I had the note 2 and loved it when I heard about the mega 6.3 I had to have it. This is the best phone I have come across. You read so many reviews saying how big it is I'm telling you don't go by what you read. If you own or even seen the note 2 or 3 its slightly bigger than that nothing to freak out about. It is pretty much identical to the note 2 or 3 so don't let ppl make you second guess it you will love it. I know I do. Also I received the phone a day and a half after I ordered it very fast shipping.  :),3/29/14,1
140750,Good entry level Windows Phone,"The good, the bad and the ugly",RL06M9ABBBGZK,"This is a decent phone for the money. Do not buy a non US version of this phone, you will not be a happy camper it you reside here. The only real thing this phone is lacking is a flash for the camera, other than that it has all the rest of the normal smartphone functions. Really nothing else compares to a Windows Phone. You can have your Apple's and Android's, I will never go back. You want a Windows Phone, especially if you use your phone for any business activities. Simply the best, Office already there, Skydrive auto upload feature of all your pictures so they are immediately backed up. Manages multiple email accounts with ease. All your contacts and everything linked to your Microsoft account so if you loose or break your phone, they are still their. Simple, easy to use, never continual updates like with iPhones that seem to take hours. Longest update will be the first time you plug it in and get the software current. After that, maybe a five minute update once a year. I highly recommend any Windows Phone made by Nokia or Samsung. I am still using a 3 year old Focus Flash that has hit the ground so many times I can't even count anymore. Swimming in mud holes, dropped from two stories up onto concrete, flies into pieces. Pick up the pieces and put it back together again just like Humpty Dumpty. I will say the one thing I look for is a metal case like my Focus Flash has, they last longer. This one cannot handle falls like that one can but it is a whole lot cheaper and wont break the bank if you break it.",3/19/14,1

The resolution is also excellent, I was really surprised at how crisp and sharp the screen was. Programs run smoothly so far with no lagging.

174379,You will lose almost 4GB to the OS and 2GB to your apps to end up with about 10GB,Rockerfeller Jones,R1Y22C7138OS7Z,"This is a great $200 phone, but bear in mind that you will only have 10GB of storage space for the rest of the life of the phone.Almost 4GB will be used up by the operating system (unless you root it and delete apps you don't need) and you'll use up initially at least 2GB when you add the traditional apps that you'll need to use the phone as a smartphone. That leaves about 10GB for user content, which, for most of us is just fine (pictures, videos, movies, etc.). So, as long as you KNOW that you'll be missing 6GB of the 16GB after the first week, this is the BEST VALUE for a $200 phone on the planet!",4/15/14,1

181633,Great Phone,Neotoma,R34ONHZ1SPH475,So far I am pleased with this phone. This is an upgrade from a Lg800g. A little bit of a learning curve as this is my first smart phone. The reception is excellent and significantly better than my Lg800g phone ever was. The WiFi reception is good but not as good as a lap top. The only thing I like better on my previous phones was the way text messages were displayed by order received.  I dislike the new messages building on previous messages from the same contact. Overall I am pleased with the phone and would recommend as a good first upgrade to a smart phone.,4/21/14,1

145872,$7 dollar decent quality case = definitely suggest to buy this before moving onto >$25 options out there.,Guzmanistan,R2Z6HKJPQ620AA,"I had some reservations, but I was surprised by the quality. The size is great - doesn't make the phone feel much bigger; the back protects the camera by ~2mm and the front lip of the case keeps the screen ~1mm of any surfaces. It stays on tight enough - it's a slap on case, so if you try to pry it off it'll come off easily. Haven't had any issues with it feeling loose going in/out of pockets. Don't get turned off by the comments about the rubberised surface - it's tacky and feels like rubber - the person who said it's slick must have tried the case out right after going to KFC.",4/25/14,1

130059,Everything I wanted,Christopher,RCR28I3BBCME3,"I don't take a lot of pictures and I don't need my phone to work like my tablet.  I wanted a sturdy phone with expandable storage that ran the Windows OS.  That is what I got with this phone.  It's pretty much the perfect size for my hand, not too thick, but doesn't feel cheap.  That back pops off and the battery is removable, another plus that I wasn't even looking for.  The wireless charging cases are pretty cheap ($15 off at&t; website) so I'll be getting one of those soon, the charging plate is probably a little more expensive though.  A protective case fits right over the removable back and can reportedly be charged wirelessly through it.  (For those that don't know, the back of this phone is removable, that's where the wireless charging case goes.  A protective cover can go on top of that for even more durability).  The sound quality isn't the best I've ever had, but then again I don't really like talking on the phone in the first place, so this gives me an excuse when my wife is chattering on and on and on.  And on and on.  And on again.  Hmm...I hope she never sees this review...Anywho, I digress....this phone is exactly what I was looking for.  Not too fancy, will most likely last me more than the 2-year contract that I'm used to with smart phones.  I like it much better than my previous HTC Windows 8X which felt cheap and had only 8GB of memory.  Both are better than my previous Android phone as I much prefer the Windows OS.",4/21/14,1

Its pretty fast i get signal everywhere. the only thing is if you use straight talk you cant recieve pics. their apn doesnt unlock pics.. but on the plus side i didn't realize when i bought it you can take screen shots when holding down the volume button & the power button at the same time.everything works great . im glad i got this phone its a good deal for the price",4/23/14,1

Pretty well, all my charms at least but this is like them. Only better. Well, battery life could always be better (lasts a day).

185007,ONE smartphone to keep (I know it's a cheesy tittle),Diego HernÃ¡ndez,R2E5SEAJLD19R7,"Before I begin this review, I have to say I enjoy smartphones and change phones every 4-6 months. For the past 4 and a half months I've been a Nexus 5 user, before that I had the Xperia Z1 and before that one I had the Samsung Galaxy S4, which means I will be able to judge according to what I've used in the past.I realized it'd be better if I left a summary of PROS & CONS before the wall of text:+ Premium look and feel, not as big on hands and at least for me, not really slippery.+ Beautiful and clear screen, even at direct sunlight.+ Micro SD expansion slot.+ Incredible and loud dual front-facing speakers.+ Pretty good camera after you learn its tricks and amazing effects like U-Focus when using properly.+ Sense 6.0, the best Android skin IMO, not invasive and it actually improves the UI instead of making it a mess.+ Gestures. With the help of a launcher you can actually avoid using the power button at all.+ Amazing battery, holds up from 6am to 11pm having Mobile data on and listening to music for more than 6 hours a day.- Metal unibody will scratch easily.- Terrible button placement for one hand use, which again, is fixable through other apps (Double tapping to lock).- Unprecise responsiveness of earphones/headphones controls (Play/Pause, Next and Previous track).- Camera could have been much better. I mean, it's not bad but there's room for improvement.Now, onto the review:FIRST IMPRESSIONS: I already knew what I was getting, I had read all the technical stuff and watched a couple of videos of the phone itself. But when I opened the box I was still blown away. The One M8 is such a great piece of smartphone, it's definetely a gorgeous phone because, as you probably read, it's made of 90% metal so it has that premium look and feel you'd expect from a flagship device.DESIGN: I honestly thought the HTC One M8 would be huge in my average size hands, but it actually was great to hold and the unibody gives it a great feel too or maybe my hands aren't as average as I believed! I was also concerned because I read from several places that due to its metal body it was pretty slippery; but I've had the phone for a week and not a single drop or slip so far. Although, I do have to say it is slippery when I have it on my pocket while sitting, it usually tends to slide out and I have to move it back once every while (Of course, this depends on how still you are or if you move your legs often). As much as I love the metal design, look and feel I think it's more of a curse than a blessing, because it scratches way too easily; this means you'll probably will have to buy a case if you don't want your phone to have the back side completely scratched, luckily there's a couple of case choices to avoid covering the beautiful back of it (I bought myself a translucid Spigen case).The one thing I think HTC got all wrong is the button placement, it's not logical or comfortable at all, but I will talk about it a little more in a while, along with the gestures system. But one point where HTC did great is on the memory expansion capabilities via MicroSD card, I listen to music most of the time and have around 40Gb of music on my phone at the moment, this was a big plus for me.SPEAKERS/AUDIO: Two of the many reasons I wanted this phone were the dual front facing speakers and in a couple of words: they don't dissappoint at all! They are simply the best I've had on a phone. Amazing loud and crystal clear sound speakers, there's no fuzziness or distortion at max volume here AND I can finally place my phone wherever without covering them. The only thing that kinda bugs me is the fact that they are not symmetrical, but I'll learn to live with it. In addition, I actually didn't expect earphones to be included, so I was a little surprised to see them. They're not bad, but I don't like the fact that the earbuds are red, so I will keep using my ATH-M50s and my Hammerheads pro.There's one thing I noticed and had issues with, the responsiveness of the handsfree button (Play/Pause, Next track and Previous track) with the default earphones and with my Hammerheads. It takes about one second after pressing it to take effect and sometimes the double tap action to skip to the next track is recognized as a triple tap, which takes me back to the previous track. Coming from the Nexus 5, where the responsiveness was immediate and precise, it will take some time to get used to.SOFTWARE, CAMERA AND BATTERY: I've always been a fan of Stock Android, which is why I loved my Nexus 5 and didn't quite enjoy the S4 and touch wiz; but I think it's safe to say I love Sense 6.0 as much or even more than Stock Android. It's not intrusive, it doesn't have drastic changes on the UI and it's simple enough to make it look great. I really liked the fact you can edit the quick settings shortcuts as you like and that they change colors according to the theme you choose, the same goes to the notification bar changing colors depending on the application you're using; I also enjoyed being able to change the font style of the whole phone with just a couple of taps. It's all about the little things.Talking about tapping the screen brings me to the next item: Gestures. This whole idea of double tapping and swiping the screen to unlock the phone made me remember my beloved Nokia N9, great concept. It also makes it a lot easier for the user to unlock the device without having to reach the awkwardly located power button. And since I'm a loyal Nova Launcher user I ended up configuring the double tap action to lock my phone, so now I have no need at all to reach the power button. The one thing I would have liked is that gestures wouldn't require a slight movement of the device to work properly because I tend to check my phone without moving it from my desk and now that requires me tapping the screen 4 times exactly to work without motion.The duo camera, as they call it, is pretty decent for what it is: A phone camera. You wouldn't replace your actual camera with it if you're into the matter; but if you're like me, a casual photographer, it'll do just fine. What I really liked was the U-Focus effect, I find myself using it quite often and after a while of playing with it you'll figure out what you need to do to make it work quite good. I say this because if you don't define well the foreground subject from the background or vice versa you'll end up with an unshareable picture. Overall, I have to say I'm quite impressed with the camera, but it's pretty obvious there are phones with better cameras on the market, I'd be lying if I said this was the best camera on a phone I've tried.On the battery side, most of my week (6/7 days) I get up at 6am and go to work, I have WiFi on throughout the day and Mobile Data when I'm commuting, answer mails and the occasional Social Networking usage (Facebook, Twitter, Line, Whatsapp and Instagram), but most importantly I can't live without music and because of that in my regular day I usually listen about 7-9 hours of music on my phone, . At the end of everyday, which is around 11pm for me, I have 20-30% left of battery; this is a bit more battery life I had at the end of the day than on my Nexus 5. To sum up: I can't complain about battery life at ALL.CONCLUSION: I'm very happy with the choice I made and I don't think I'll be changing phones for a good while; sure there are a couple of things I would change, but nothing drastic and nothing that'd be a deal breaker for me. Overall, it's an amazing phone and I would recommend it to most people.",4/20/14,1

174912,Better than any phone around its price.,JoanG,R3I7JG3VS3JDOG,"Ok. I'll start this review by saying that i've read so many reviews and critics about this phone. So have you, I guess. But I'm writing this review after 2 weeks of hard core using this phone. This is what i think:1.- Camera: The camera is a good camera, better than any 5mp camera i've used. Nice perfomance at morning or high iluminated places. At night the perfomance is not that bad, it's true that it's not the same but the flash does its job. For social media: instagram, snapchat and all thoses it's just great :)  (With a 3rd part app like cymera the camera gets better) 6/10.2.- Battery: In these two weeks I've been playing Asphalt 8, reproducing music, using google now and chatting (WhatsApp and BBM) The autonomy of the battery has been enough. I mean, i'd like a bit more, but we're talking 4hrs of screen display while playing such a core game like Asphalt 8. I have not tried how many screen hours it lasts w/o playing or reproducing music. But I assure you that if you're not a hard core user you will get 7 screen hours and of course, even if you are, by the end of the day your phone will be still alive :) 8/10.3.- Perfomance: Can't complain. I can play any game I want, I can run as many apps as I want, I can switch from any app to another quickly and easily. I'm not giving a 10 just because sometimes when I'm playing Asphalt, if I recive a phone call, once it is finished, The game app restarts and that's normal, but it's something that Android Should improve and not Motorola. (It happens even with Galaxy s3) 9/10.4.- Design: I like the fact that they designed a space on the back cover so we can put our finger on it and it's very comfortable. But I don't like the frames. I think that there's an useless space on the lower one and I don't like it. But this phone is highly accurate on its designed. I mean, the back cover is curved so we don't have to neccesarily put the phone upside in order to listen to music. (I'm missing more colors on the notification LED)  8/10.5.- Others (Display, storage..) The Display is the best thing about this phone. It is beautiful 720p that with a 4.5 screen gives us a high quality view that some 1080p screens dont give to us. Storage? 8gb are ENOUGH for me!  I mean, this phone supports OTG. I have Asphalt (1.5gb game) on the phone, and more apps like Subway Sufers, Whatsapp, bbm, youtube, snapchat, dolphin, cymera, mega, marca and more...) and lots of pictures and i still have 1gb remaining. You have 50gb free on Google Drive and if you don't like drive you also have mega for android that does almost the same thing with 50gb free too. Recording videos will take all your memory, so you should move then to a sd card and take advantage of the OTG support.  If you want more, go for the 16 gb version, but 8 gb (5.5) are enough if you know how to use them.  10/10Conclussions:There's no phone in the market better than this one comparing prices. It gives the perfomance of a high end phone and you pay for a low range phone. If you don't need the best camera ever you should buy this phone.Extra:Moto G has nano-coating so if the phone gets wet it will not die. (You don't believeme, do you?) Search on youtube, you will see :):)More?Yes! There's more. Buy the phone and you will see. Im very happy, happiest person in the word when i received my phone and it was actually more than I expected. As i Said. So many, I had read so many good reviews but it was even more than people said.",4/10/14,1

153618,"I highly recommend this phone! A middle of the road, average specs phone with top performances. Moto X is setting new standards",Yann,RYLEA8SXGT7RU,"I come from the iPhone... I love the iPhone or should I say... I loved the iPhone.My iPhone 5 broke on me a while back and  like a guy that wants to know if the neighbors wife better than his own, I decided that I wanted to try an android phone.Since I come from an top tier Phone I went and bought the top tier... HTC one. That was a greatish experience and I kind of enjoyed it... but then I lost it somewhere (probably in a cab).Since my first Android experience with the HTC was somewhat good and I was sick of breaking or loosing 600$+ phones, I decided I would buy a middle of the road, not to pricey, ok phone.Then the Moto X came in the mail: Holy Crap! Snappy as hell, every thing I used to run on my high end phones runs just as smooth on this one. But that is not what makes this phone stand out.Stock Android + a few tweaks like the active display and touchless control sets this phone apart... More than that, it sets new standards, something that very very few phone have done in years.I could not go back to a phone that would have me press a button to display the time. Sound trivial.. maybe it is, but I'm lazy and you are to... you just don't know it yet.Touchless control is great... I love seeing the jealous eyes of iPhone owners when I say ok google now without touching it and the screen pops up.Other android phone makers should take notes here: Why invest money in designing a stupid custom baked layer of creamy OS crap on top of the already excellent Android (looking at you HTC and Samsung) . Vanilla Android is oh! so much better, lighter, cleaner, sleeker, snappier and simpler.You should not care about this phone specs:Get this phone!It is the proof that 700$ phones are overpriced and overrated.",4/19/14,1

Did i mention Price?-Bright, Color Accurate screen with a resolution of 1280x720, equal to 2012's flagship phones such as the nexus 4, Galaxy s3, and surpasses the Iphone 5s in screen size as well as resolution, with an even higher Pixel Density that the Retina Display on the IPhone 5s.-This comes with 50 GB of free Google Drive Storage for 2 YEARS, what a deal!-Comes with a 1.3 mp front camera, which is actually a luxury in this price range-Custom Motorola apps such as Motorola Assist and Motorola Migrate which are both very useful-Easily unlockable bootloader, with steps provided from Motorola themselvesCons:-Decent Camera, that can be a nightmare with grain in low light-No 4g LTE-No NFC-No Sd Card slot for storing videos, music, photos as well as app data, but 50 GB of Drive Data can handle your videos and photos, and 8/16 gb can handle your app data-Would be awesome if there was a 32 GB version of this device so i could store more large sized GamesIn Conclusion, this device has had some corners cut to achieve this amazing price. Some features that have been cut dont matter too much to average consumers such as NFC, but the price is the central feature of this phone and the price to performance ratio is great on this phone.

185195,A Samsung Evolution,Johnny SaigonÂ®,R1U62J1953K6Z2,"First off, I am not a professional reviewer, nor am I employed or compensated by Samsung or any other company. Instead of boring you with facts - which you can find anywhere on the Net - I will just give you some real-world impressions on how it looks, feels, and runs. With that out of the way, let's get to the point and the nitty gritty, shall we?* THE SCREEN - that is the very first thing you will notice when you look at the S5. Samsung has found its niche with AMOLED screens, which are BRIGHT & SATURATED. Everything almost literally jumps out at you, and sometimes even too much so. I had to switch to the natural setting, as the vivid and even standard profiles are too saturated(and FAKE) for me. It's better as a demo unit to draw you in, but for everyday use, I recommend switching to the natural profile.FACTS: The Galaxy S5 has a 5.1-inch Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen with Full HD resolution - 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~432 ppi pixel density, plus Gorilla Glass 3 to protect the screen from scratches.* The Look - the S5 has a more squared-off edges look than the S4, which is more squared off than the S3, but all three are not as angular as the S2. In terms of roundness-to square-ness, it goes from the S3 - S4 - S5 - S2 (the original S just looks like an iPhone 3GS). Check out my images for an easier comparison. The S5 is the tallest and widest, but not the thickest of the Galaxy S's. The best thing I can say about this is it's an evolution. Beauty is subjective, so judge for yourself. The front side is almost the same as any other Galaxy phone: You have the physical Home button, flanked by the back and menu capacitive buttons. Probably the most improved aspect of the design is in its functionality - it is now dust-proof, and water-proof up to 3 feet!FACTS: The dimensions are 5.59 x 2.85 x 0.32(142cm x 72.5cm x 8.1cm), and weighs 5.11oz(145g).* The Feel - Samsung has taken a lot of flack for making the Galaxy S line so cheap looking and feeling with its plastic bodies, for being the top Android phone maker. HTC has been known to have the best craftsmanship with their all-metal One phones. Perhaps Samsung feel they are so dominant that they don't have to spend more to mass-produce metal phones, but since they don't want to come off as too arrogant, so their compromise is a dimpled, faux-rubber backside like the Nexus 7(2012) and its very own Galaxy Note 3. It definitely gives a better feel - it doesn't slip and slide in your hands or pockets anymore - but it cannot compare to the feel and craftsmanship of the HTC One(both the m7 and m8). It is on the right track though, so let's hope that rumored luxury F line or next year's S6 will continue to get better.* How it Runs - This phone is fast, fast, FAST! With a 2.5gHz Snapdragon 801, it has the fastest processor out there right now. It terms of real speed, I cannot say if it is faster than the HTC One m8 or the Sony Xperia Z2, but it is definitely up there. When you touch an app icon to launch it, it launches nearly instantly. To really see how this phone flies, just open the gallery app and scroll through all your photos and you'll see what I mean. Usually the gallery is where most phones stutter as it tries to load all your photos and albums - but NOT the S5!* The Camera - FINALLY! Samsung has decided to make a decent camera, and not just as an afterthought. This 16mp camera is really awesome, so much better than the S4. I would always get washed out images with my S3/S4/Note 2, but with the S5, it actually looks like it's from a decent point-and-shoot dedicated camera with crisp, bright, and saturated images. Low-light shooting is also vastly improved, although not as good as the new HTC One m8. 16mp means 5312 x 2988 -resolution images, so you can actually blow them up or crop them down without fearing the dreaded pixelation monster. There are a myriad of other cool and useful camera features that I will save for you to find out(like macro and Google Street View modes :]). And lastly, the focus is quick, quick, QUICK! Nearly instantaneous focus allows you to capture those hard-to-capture moments easier. A definitely thumbs up to Samsung for paying attention to the camera and its functions.* Software - I'm still trying to figure out everything, as there is A LOT of stuff under the hood. Samsung's TouchWiz user interface this time around is A LOT less intrusive though, as much as can be without being totally stock Android, I guess. The layout and iconography are flatter and simpler, and for the better in my view. There is also a new sensor on the back, just beneath the camera lens. It is a heart-rate monitor/pedometer, and it comes with its own health app called S Health. There is a new battery-saving mode which can save you precious minutes when you're caught in a bind. All in all, I think this version is a lot nicer-looking, more responsive, and better than the precious S phones.The ultimate question is whether this phone is a worthy upgrade over the S4. As my review title suggests, it is an evolution, an incremental upgrade over the S4. So with that said I cannot whole-heartedly recommend it if you already have a good phone, or even over the S4. But I do feel this upgrade is more vast and much better than from the S3 to the S4, so in that sense Samsung has done a much better job this year. If you are switching from an older phone that was made at least 2 years ago, then I would tell you jump right in and try the S5 - it will not disappoint you. But for those with already a good phone, and/or say you just finished year one of your 2-year contract, then I would say think hard before you make the leap. For my money, I think the Note 4 and S6 will be the bigger upgrades more worth waiting for.",4/7/14,1

174367,Motorola Moto G,Alan D. Jones,R3IZZGB50X2ML0,"While searching for a phone to use with Straight Talk I searched and viewed 100's of phones online. The Moto G seemed like it had the price/performance I was looking for but I was wrong. This phone exceeded expectations.When I first set the phone up through straight talk I went and checked for updates. A 190MB update was available, which is the upgrade to Android 4.4.2. I was at work and elected to download over 3G data stream figuring it would take a while. This downloaded in about 5 minutes thanks to the  HSPA+ (High-Speed Packet Access Plus) network connection. It has been smooth sailing since. My batter lasts about 12-14 hours on a normal work day with little talking, social media and texting. I get about 8 hours with game play and heavy usage. The 16GB is plenty of storage especially if you use Google Drive to store photos and videos.The phone does go into a reduced state after sitting for a while saving battery I am sure. When I pick it up I get a No Internet message. A simple refresh solves this appearance of a problem.I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good featured phone with great battery at a great price. Rumor is that this style phone will not be made again due to the low or non-existent profit margins. If a new generation comes along I will probably upgrade if the price/performance makes sense. Until then I am happy with this great phone!",4/29/14,1
113860,Loved it.,Juggalette Tink3R,R277YT7JMWJNK8,"I loved it, it was exactly what I was looking for :) I've upgraded quite a bit since this though but it is still worth the buy.",4/1/14,1
168820,"Beautiful phone, beautiful experience.",J. John,R36ZG6X0SYHEAS,"My review of the Nexus 5.The things I didn't like:1. The speaker is probably the worst part of the phone. Even when you use headphones, it's too quiet. I actually use my Moto G when I want to listen music so that's a real turn off.2. The battery life - I have watched reviews that suggests the battery life will get better with time. I've only had this phone for about a week but it has never gotten me through a full day. It maxes out at about 7 hours so I always have to take my charger. I won't consider myself a heavy user. I use my phone to do mainly chatting, your typical social media stuff, news, internet browsing etc. I don't do gaming or movie watching - so considering that I really expected a full day. I'm still waiting to see if it gets better with time.3. The camera - is a weak point on this phone. It carries a 1.3MP front camera - which is really as bad as it gets on a high end smart phone. This camera is really ok for skype etc... won't give you any good photos at all. The back camera is a 8MP, I will say this camera exceeded my expectations because I've heard so many bad things about it I guess I bought it expecting the worst. I'm yet to take any photos with HDR+ enabled and the quality of the photos are satisfactory. With phones around with 13, 26, 20 and even higher MP, if you're really into photo and video taking, I won't recommend this phone. You're never going to impress anybody with any photo that comes from this phone - never mind it was marketed for these purposes.I will add that there is a new google camera app that was launched last week that makes the experience a better one and includes the lens blur feature of the HTC one (M8) but it reduces the quality of the photo in this mode. As google continues to update the camera app I imagine the experience in this department will only get better.4. Design - I don't mind the simplicity of it but I will admit the iphone 5s and the HTC one (M8) are incredibly sexier and more pleasing to the eyes. So too but less so is the Sony Z2. Phones like the Moto X and the HTC one (M8) are invariably gonna feel better in your hand as well.5. The display. I wasn't sure what people meant by the display being 'washed out'. I found out when I bought this phone. Holding it up beside the Moto G, the display on the Moto G (which is quite incredible I must say) looked better. Something is off with the colours but I find when the brightness is turned all the way up it looks better. Why does the colours change with dimming the display - I'm not sure. Apart from that though, the display is boss.I have not experienced any connectivity problems with this phone.What I love:1. The price. I can't afford an iphone 5s (won't buy one even if I could), the s5, the Z2 or the M8. This phone is always compared to these phones despite the huge price difference. The fact of comparison alone says a lot regardless of the verdict.2. Software - 4.4.2 - I love having the latest and greatest OS and being first in line for every update. Google Now is deeply integrated and there is zero bloatware. These are three things that are highly important to me. At the end of the day, software is what you're going to be interacting with each time you turn on or unblock your phone so I can't think of anything that could be more important.3. Performance. The OS makes specs less important than they use to be because it requires less. For that reason, the Nexus 5 performs just as good and even better than other flagship devices. It can handle any app you throw at it and after one week the phone has not stopped to take a breather. There are other phones that have better specs and it doesn't make them better - they require more to handle the bloatware that bugs down the device. Don't be fooled in this regard - the Nexus 5 has everything under the hood you could ever need.Keep in mind this phone does not allow storage extension.I still give this phone 5 stars because it is obviously intended to target a specific set of people - people like me who place software at the top of the list of priorities alongside price. There really isn't a better phone you'd get at this price.There is no such thing as 'the best phone' - phones are different just as people are different and they are made to meet different needs. You have to know what you want out of your device and I found what I needed out of the Nexus 5. If the strengths of the phone are not important to you and the weaknesses are I could easily recommend a different phone.I'd surely recommend this phone to those whose attention its trying to get - it is a deal you should not miss.",4/21/14,1
170798,Great phone.,Ai Wintermute,R2A0FVAC20WIQZ,"I am replacing my BLU LIFE VIEW with this phone and at first it was hard going from a HUGE 5.7 screen to the tiny 4.5, but its a very nice screen.My primary reason for the switch was the Moto G's water proofness, after watching a review by Erica Griffin on Youtube, her using the phone under water for 30 minutes, means this phone will work great on my new electric bike on rainy days.KIT KAT 4.4.2 is very nice as well, right out of the box it performed an OTA update to 4.4.2.",4/3/14,1

I was a little dissapointed that you don't get the excellent e-mail service through BlackBerry servers on OS 10, but after discovering the excellent hardware (the device is super fast and works quickly with any app) and the ability to install Android apps - I really love my Q10! It has everything that I want and need, including the QWERT keyboard, but without the annoyance of being an actual Android device.

185005,iOS to Android,YimYorm,RVBKW20LNMFM0,"About Me: I have been the Apple fanboy for the past few years. From the 3GS to iPhone 5S and Macbook and iPad geek. Never owned a flagship Android base phone. I am an average technology geek look for high end technology at low budget costs for good features.Impressions: Since the M7 to the M8 Leaks, I had fallen in love with the phone. The elegant and classy look just compelled my eyes. I knew I had to have this phone. The front speakers and overall appearance of the phone stole me. I went in blind to the Android world.The M8: I have been using the phone for the past 5 days, and I have to say I absolutely love the phone. Everyday I learn something new about the phone and it surprises me. The fast processor loads programs in a flash then multitasking is amazing.The so called bad crappy is not of an issue to me since im not a big camera fanatic and it shouldnt be a big judgement on the phone. Personally, I find myself having so much fun with the camera from the 3D dimensions to the unfocusing and stickers.  The front speakers are really amazing sounds like concert coming from the phone. The 5 inch 1080p display is amazing to watch videos and just gaze at your phone. The slim design makes comfortable in one hand. The catches other iOS users to analyze my phone consider actually buying it. Its great phone and I would recommend to everyone. Never worry about space with the extra MicroSD slot.Pros:-Sleek & Elegant.-Front Speakers-Camera Effects(find your self becoming a photographer)-Face Recognition unlocking-4.4.2 Kit Kat-Motion Launch-MicroSD(Up 128GB)-Ultra Fast load times.- Control your TVCons:-UltraPixel Camera(sometime you can notice it, not a big concern)-Not waterproofPersonally to me no real cons.Good phone to transfer over to if your a iOS user.",4/11/14,1

I never understood this about people that require super duper high megapixel count on their camera if the social sites they post these on will auto adjust the image to fit within the websites parameters, guys you dont need 20 megapixels on your profile pic. This camera does the job superbly.Pros: screen size, colors, solid feel, the boomsound speakers!!! never knew how important this would be until i got this phone my old galaxy had speakers on the back and ya it worked but who thought of that ? it makes no sense these face forward and they are a steroeo pair so the sound coming out during movies or youtube or music is awesome.",4/26/14,1

180772,Amazing but with a few disappointments,Amazon Customer,R1MYFLDAQ67UTX,"This is a great phone. It has everything it is advertised with. I wasn't expecting to get the free headset, so that is a bonus. The only really disappointing thing about this phone is that despite having 2 gigs of RAM, you get to use less than 1 of them because the OS uses so much of it already. Don't get me wrong, the phone is still fast, and it hardly stutters on 3D games, but I figured I could get tons of multitasking out of it. Other wise, it lived up to all expectations, even the only having 9 gigs to work with on the phone itself. A big plus that I wasn't aware of though, is that you can move some select apps to your SD card. That makes this phones memory go a whole lot farther and the fact that it has an SD slot made it a pick over the LG G2.

184930,iOS to Android,YimYorm,RVBKW20LNMFM0,"About Me: I have been the Apple fanboy for the past few years. From the 3GS to iPhone 5S and Macbook and iPad geek. Never owned a flagship Android base phone. I am an average technology geek look for high end technology at low budget costs for good features.Impressions: Since the M7 to the M8 Leaks, I had fallen in love with the phone. The elegant and classy look just compelled my eyes. I knew I had to have this phone. The front speakers and overall appearance of the phone stole me. I went in blind to the Android world.The M8: I have been using the phone for the past 5 days, and I have to say I absolutely love the phone. Everyday I learn something new about the phone and it surprises me. The fast processor loads programs in a flash then multitasking is amazing.The so called bad crappy is not of an issue to me since im not a big camera fanatic and it shouldnt be a big judgement on the phone. Personally, I find myself having so much fun with the camera from the 3D dimensions to the unfocusing and stickers.  The front speakers are really amazing sounds like concert coming from the phone. The 5 inch 1080p display is amazing to watch videos and just gaze at your phone. The slim design makes comfortable in one hand. The catches other iOS users to analyze my phone consider actually buying it. Its great phone and I would recommend to everyone. Never worry about space with the extra MicroSD slot.Pros:-Sleek & Elegant.-Front Speakers-Camera Effects(find your self becoming a photographer)-Face Recognition unlocking-4.4.2 Kit Kat-Motion Launch-MicroSD(Up 128GB)-Ultra Fast load times.- Control your TVCons:-UltraPixel Camera(sometime you can notice it, not a big concern)-Not waterproofPersonally to me no real cons.Good phone to transfer over to if your a iOS user.",4/11/14,1

174402,"Amaizing phone for it's price, a small review from a Venezuelan",Luis David Leal BriceÃ±o,R1QTPKVROIGUDT,"This smartphone is incredible, it has a lot of perfomance in games and multitask app's.It has pure Android from Google, it doesn't have any kind of junk application that can slow down the phone, the camera is really good, I have no idea why people destroys the camera because of it's megapixels, don't believe that, the quality in overall is amaizing for the price and the slow motion camera is a really good function that doesn't have a lot of smartphones of high price.I'm from Venezuela and the Kitkat version of Android is available for download and even the latest update for Kitkat too, really good signal in closed areas and the 3G works nicely.I recommended it in every way, the best purchase I have done so far for just 200$",4/2/14,1
183658,I love this phone! But...,Michael Johnson,R37B70UUSYKNN2,"Apps: I recently upgraded the the S5 from the S3. My S3 is running the latest version of cyanogenmod. With this in mind, I have noticed very little difference in the speed of apps compared to my S5 which is still running the stock ROM.Screen: The screen is larger but it isn't something to get worked up about. This makes the iPhone 5(any model) feel so much smaller in my hands when I play with a friend's phone.Battery: I have noticed better battery life on the S5. I have been using the same apps, checking the phone often, and leaving all wireless services on and have been able to go from 6am to midnight with only needing a short charge in the middle of the day.Fingerprint Scanner: I absolutely do not like this system that Samsung has decided to use. First, you must swipe your finger straight down and must use the entire pad. It is very awkward to do this holding the phone with one hand in a natural position. Fruthermore, if you have a case on your phone, it is practically impossible to use the scanner. I have a Pelican case on mine (similar to the Otterbox defender series) and can sometimes get a correct read if I use my off hand to hold the phone while the other swipes. This means the scanner is useless for me personally.IR: I really enjoy this feature! With one remote and multiple people in the house, the TV remote is often misplaced. With the IR blaster I can just sit down and not worry about trying to find the remote in the cushions.Heartbeat Monitor: This feature takes a few tries to get used to but seems to work well once you get the hang of it. You want to just lightly let your finger rest over the scanner and you should get a result every time. I have had results be as far as 10bmp off within a matter of seconds of each other. However, I would assume you are not wanting to purchase this device because you need a super accurate heart monitor.USB 3.0: USB 3.0 is amazing! The charging port on the S5? Not so much. Due to the increased water resistant capabilities, the S5 comes with a charging port cover. This cover tends to be in the way when I try to plug my phone in at night and even more so when a case is on the phone. I am also still using a micro USB charger (it is already in place and routed perfectly on my nightstand). This tends to be an issue, esspecially in the dark, as it is not always easy finding the right spot the micro charger plugs into. Once in, the phone seems to charge at the same rate as the S3.Overall: I really like this phone and do not regret this purchase even though it may seem I have nothing but complaints about it. I chose the S5 over the 5s due to OS restrictive apps that I use (such as Tasker). I chose the S5 over the M8 for a few reasons. Firstly because I have the ability to remove the back cover and change out the battery. While I have never needed to actually replace a battery on any android I have owned, I have needed to remove it on occasion when tinkering with rooting and such. Secondly, the M8 does not include Qi charging. Nor does the S5, however, there are kits you can order that will give you Qi ability underneath the back cover with the S5 (S4 and S3 as well). I have ordered one of these kits due to the charging port of the S5. The S5 is another great Samsung mobile device and I expect it should last me until my next upgrade date.",4/27/14,1
135919,Great phone if you like them big.,Mario9577,R2R6PE42GBF5X4,"This phone is really nice for the price. It's very fast and responsive so far.

I recieved a certified like new (refurbished) phone, with a non working charger and no rubberidium stylus. Amazon customer service made it right by me, this is why you always by direct from Amazon or Fulfilled by Amazon. I do however love the phone and think that it is great for someone like me who wants a large screen and doesn't want to lose thier verizon unlimted data, but doesn't want to spend $400 to $700 for a phone.",4/15/14,1

157361,as good as expected,Neil Fore,R15WFH8NV49BVL,"I'm on AT&T; and am not an international traveler.  I mainly bought this Note 3 variant for its rare chipset (the Exynos 5 Octa), and I'm aware that it doesn't support 4G LTE.If you're in the same boat, I can give this phone the thumbs up.  Setup was easy (insert SIM card and turn on), and I measured my data connection to be ~7Mbps (800-900 KB/s).  Basically, no headaches or surprises.However, consider saying no when the phone asks you to accept a firmware upgrade.  I learned the hard way that Android 4.4 KitKat puts severe restrictions on writing to the microSD card, crippling any file browser, file editor, etc.  That's an Android-wide feature, though, not a Note 3 bug.",4/12/14,1

The onboard Android OS is vanilla, without any of the crap that AT&T;/Samsung/Motorola/Sprint/etc. like to shove on them, so it's very quick. Screen looks good, build quality is good.

183573,Evolutionary NOT revolutionary!,rpv,R1NWP2IK3TUSVQ,"Oh, Another year, another set of phones from manufacturers!  I have been hooked onto get the latest phone every year syndrome and love reviewing specifics. Disclaimer, I love Android and have been using from very early days. I will not call Samsung Galaxy S5 as revolutionary, but it is certainly evolutionary. If you have an older phone more than 2 years old, absolutely get this. I love Samsung Galaxy S5 from its competitors for few reasons - removable battery, microSD card support and the maturity of the product. I have been using a S5 for past couple of days and have ordered a unlocked one from my local store. There are so many variants already in the market. So do check local specs. For example, in china market dual SIM S5 is available.Galaxy S5's back plate has a perforated dot pattern and a excellent matte finish. As a result, the phone looks far more sophisticated than its past designs despite its plastic build. Its surface feels nice to the touch without being too rough or too slippery.  I really do _not_ care about the plastic, in fact the lightweight nature is what I care. Some people make a huge deal out of it. A high quality plastic is good for lightweight and I go with lightweight than a heavy phone in the pocket. A reputed tech site called recently Samsung as the â€œundisputed king of the Android smartphone spaceâ€ù. True indeed. With the plethora of devices in tablets/phones, they have iterated so much that they can produce truly stunning products.If you care for weight, the Galaxy S4 is lighter than S5.  (please see my stats below).  In fact pixel density is slightly higher in S4 due to a 0.1in size difference. So get an S4, it is cheaper and still same phone that came out last year. If you care for heart rate monitor, fingerprint scanner, and water proof, get the S5. Otherwise literally similar set and you can save a lot by getting S4 now. Last year when S4 came out it was a great phone. It still is, though S5 came out now. Obsoletion is in the mind of the us, not on the devices.In my opinion, following are key specs to consider when you buying a phone. Most of others are standard or does not matter at all. First size,weight and resolution are part of look and feel. RAM/CPU part of performance. external Storage is part of expandability. Camera is obvious! SAR  (Specific Absorption Rating) is an often ignored, but I feel essential to making a buying choice. Manufacturers donâ€™t advertize or mention SAR prominently.phone parameters: {size, weight, resolution, ppi, RAM, ext Storage, camera, CPU, USA SAR rating}Samsung Galaxy S5: 5.59 x 2.85 x 0.32 in, 145 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.1 in, 432 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, Qualcomm Snapdragon 801,  MSM8974-AC  Processor:  Quad core, 2500 MHz, Krait 400, 0.63 W/kg (head), 0.82 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy S4 (Intl version):  5.38 x 2.75 x 0.31 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.0 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD, up to 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5410 CPU, Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, 0.85 W/kg (head), 1.55 W/kg (body)HTC One M8: 5.76 x 2.78 x 0.37 in, 160 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5 in, 441 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD upto 128 GB!, 4 MP (rear), 5 MP(front for selfies), Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, Quad core, 2300 MHz, Krait 400, 0.94 W/kg (head), 0.83 W/kg (body)LG G2: 5.45 x 2.79 x 0.35 in, 143 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.2 in, 424 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 13 MP/2.1 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.26 GHz Krait 400, 0.50 W/kg (head), 0.69 W/kg (body)Google Nexus 5: 5.43 x 2.72 x 0.34 in, 130 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 4.95 in, 445 ppi, 2 GB RAM, no ext Storage, 8 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800, Quad-core 2.3 GHz Krait 400, 0.92 W/kg (head), 1.23 W/kg (body)Apple iPhone 5S: 4.87 x 2.31 x 0.30 in, 112gm, 640 x 1136 pixels, 4.0 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 8 MP/1.2 MP, Apple A7, Dual-core 1.3 GHz Cyclone (ARM v8-based), 1.12 W/kg (head), 1.18 W/kg (body)Samsung Galaxy Note 3 N9000: 5.95 x 3.12 x 0.33 in, 168 gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.7 in, 386 ppi, 3 GB RAM, micro SD upto 64 GB, 13 MP/2MP, Exynos 5 Octa 5420, Quad-core 1.9 GHz Cortex-A15 & quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 0.24 W/kg (head), 0.72 W/kg (body)Nokia Lumia 1520: 6.41 x 3.36 x 0.34 in, 209gm, 1080 x 1920 pixels, 6.0 in, 367 ppi, 2 GB RAM, microSD up to 64 GB, 20 MP/1.2MP,  Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800 CPU  Quad-core 2.2 GHz Krait 400, SAR: 0.59 W/kg (head), 0.24 W/kg (body)Motorola Moto G: 5.11 x 2.59 x 0.46 in, 143 gm, 720 x 1280 pixels, 4.5 in, 326 ppi, 1 GB RAM, no ext storage, 5 MP/1.3 MP, Qualcomm Snapdragon 400, Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7, SAR: 1.17 W/kg (head), 1.06 W/kg (body)Given the above key specs, my suggestion to my friends is to choose 2 or 3 KEY features you require (may be large screen size, maybe less weight, maybe more CPU power) and then start nailing down the phones. Definitely and definitely go to a phone or a big box store and feel the phone. Nothing replaces that. In the end end you are using it for days and years, so the tactile feel is very important.SCREEN SIZE/RESOLUTION:I have experimented with many phone sizes and I have come to a conclusion 5â€ù is the best form factor for me. Your mileage may vary, but after using Note for a while, I donâ€™t use it as a primary phone.  The display in S5 is absolutely stunning with a Super AMOLED display and you have to see to feel it!ANDROID UI:S5 has Android 4.4.2 KitKat out of the box. User Interface hasa flatter and simpler design, as is now the trend across the industry. Once you get used to user interface you get used to it. Android is very flexible and when I show my phone to a iPhone users they are usually in awe. I recently to my friends shows the details of processes. battery usage like which process takes up more battery, Qi charging receivers for wireless charging on Galaxy phones and they were in awe.WATER PROOF:Obviously I have not tested this!,  but a very nice to have feature and gives a peace of mindCAMERA:This can just replace a point and shoot camera. Wait, what is a point and shoot camera?! Very impressive. S5 has a 16MP camera with super-fast autofocus, HDR mode with real-time preview, and support for 4K video recording. Definitely state of the art.  I took several indoor photos and they look great. It will be interesting to see how photos appear in a vanilla S5 which Google will release.S-HEALTH:I rely and use S-Health more than any other app in my Galaxy S5. It has driven my fitness regimen to a very good progress and the design of app is nothing short of buttery and beautiful. I am often too in good favor of Samsung loading the phones with S-Ware, but their design of S-Health is definitely breathtaking. Heart rate monitor is a great addition to the fitness tools. I used it for walking several steps and found it same as in S4.PROCESSING POWER:Donâ€™t bother about it.  For 99% of users, this is good enough. The phone has more processing power than the rocket that went to moon first time and much more. The games are very smooth, the UI is very smooth.Qi WIRELESS CHARGING:I wonder why Samsung does not release wireless charging built in. You have to get a external Qi wireless charger and open the back, align it and use with a Qi charger. It should be integrated, but you can do it after the fact.NFC Tags:Wow, this is the most underrated in all reviews. Get bunch (  I mean  around 10) of NFC Tags and use in bedrooms, offices, cars, living room and customize what your phone wants to do in those areas. For example in my S4, when  I enter the car most often I use a) Navigation b) Listen to Podcasts. So I program my NFC tags accordingly using apps like Trigger and tap my phone to the NFC Tag and boom, phone does both. I am programming my S5 also to do host of things.128 GB Micro SD card!!This is just incredible. If you see my reviews, I have been saying having external capacity is very key. With a 4K camcorder you can fill your space in a blink of the eye. Movies take up space. Who would have thought a 128 GB tiny card can fit in  a phone. This is just incredible. I tested with a 128 GB  and it works wonderfully! A 16 GB phone memory will have around 10 GB spare initially.OTG - USB Hosts:This is also often ignored feature in many reviews.  On the GO USB cable + S5 means you can use with external hard disks, and virtually many of USB devices. If you have a thumb drive and have files, you can in fact read with a phone and donâ€™t necessarily have to open  a laptop. works out of the box.BATTERY:Do you really need to care for battery anymore. I donâ€™t. Just use the phone. I have battery power banks with capacity as high as 30,000 mAh to 8000 mAh that I can charge virtually anywhere without a power supply. So this has become moot for me in past year. I would also suggest you get power banks and not really care of battery drainage. Use the phone and enjoy!MISC FEATURES:I tested fingerprint scanner, but I am not sure how reliable it will be over time with scratches/oily fingers etc. I have to test it further, but for now I will settle on traditional passwords till bugs are ironed out.  Appleâ€™s initial fingerprint software had bugs which was fixed subsequently. There are so many other features in S5. Some of them have become so standard that they are not review worthy!  e.g., Infrared for wireless remotes, GPS etc. GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up).To give a sample, I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon Mobile, Androidify, Angry Birds (multiple themes), Asphalt 8, Box, Chrome, NAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps), TOM TOM, , Google Navigation/Earth/Maps, Google Currents (nice way to read News), Google Drive, Ebay, Linkedin, Google Music, Tapatalk (awesome forum browsing app), Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good), Microsoft Office, (yes they hve for Android!), Subsonic Music Streamer, TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client), Twit.Tv, Trigger, Google VoiceAsk questions, the review cannot do justice to Galaxy S5. I will be glad to answer any questions within 24 hours.",4/11/14,1
170789,Best Value Smartphone... EVER.,Jian L.,R1JMGV18NW2MD7,"This is the best smartphone under 350 bucks. (Under $351 would be the Nexus 5). Anyway, if I would guess how much this phone costs before I knew the price, I would guess 400-500 dollars off contract. This phone is AMAZING for the price. It runs the graphically intense games just fine. I put all the settings on max or at least high. The screen is also very good. 720 isn't that big of a difference to 1080. 326 pixels per inch? Hell yeah! The battery life is pretty impressive too. You get a whole day of heavy usage and still have some juice left over tomorrow for a few hours. The only downsides of this phone is the following: No 4G, no NFC, and no storage expansion. Go with the 16GB, trust me. Oh and did I tell you this phone was near WATERPROOF? Yes, that is right. Youtube Moto G water test. So that's about it. Great device for amazing price. Go Motorola!",4/9/14,1

I have been following the progress of Microsoft and Windows Phone and it looks like it will continue to be a good fit for us.Even though Windows Phone has fewer apps available, it has the ones I need and there is something to be said for not having to try out 10 apps to find one you like.",4/7/14,1

186006,A Samsung Evolution,Johnny SaigonÂ®,RGHPC6H6A4HOR,"First off, I am not a professional reviewer, nor am I employed or compensated by Samsung or any other company. Instead of boring you with facts - which you can find anywhere on the Net - I will just give you some real-world impressions on how it looks, feels, and runs. With that out of the way, let's get to the point and the nitty gritty, shall we?* THE SCREEN - that is the very first thing you will notice when you look at the S5. Samsung has found its niche with AMOLED screens, which are BRIGHT & SATURATED. Everything almost literally jumps out at you, and sometimes even too much so. I had to switch to the natural setting, as the vivid and even standard profiles are too saturated(and FAKE) for me. It's better as a demo unit to draw you in, but for everyday use, I recommend switching to the natural profile.FACTS: The Galaxy S5 has a 5.1-inch Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen with Full HD resolution - 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~432 ppi pixel density, plus Gorilla Glass 3 to protect the screen from scratches.* The Look - the S5 has a more squared-off edges look than the S4, which is more squared off than the S3, but all three are not as angular as the S2. In terms of roundness-to square-ness, it goes from the S3 - S4 - S5 - S2 (the original S just looks like an iPhone 3GS). Check out my images for an easier comparison. The S5 is the tallest and widest, but not the thickest of the Galaxy S's. The best thing I can say about this is it's an evolution. Beauty is subjective, so judge for yourself. The front side is almost the same as any other Galaxy phone: You have the physical Home button, flanked by the back and menu capacitive buttons. Probably the most improved aspect of the design is in its functionality - it is now dust-proof, and water-proof up to 3 feet!FACTS: The dimensions are 5.59 x 2.85 x 0.32(142cm x 72.5cm x 8.1cm), and weighs 5.11oz(145g).* The Feel - Samsung has taken a lot of flack for making the Galaxy S line so cheap looking and feeling with its plastic bodies, for being the top Android phone maker. HTC has been known to have the best craftsmanship with their all-metal One phones. Perhaps Samsung feel they are so dominant that they don't have to spend more to mass-produce metal phones, but since they don't want to come off as too arrogant, so their compromise is a dimpled, faux-rubber backside like the Nexus 7(2012) and its very own Galaxy Note 3. It definitely gives a better feel - it doesn't slip and slide in your hands or pockets anymore - but it cannot compare to the feel and craftsmanship of the HTC One(both the m7 and m8). It is on the right track though, so let's hope that rumored luxury F line or next year's S6 will continue to get better.* How it Runs - This phone is fast, fast, FAST! With a 2.5gHz Snapdragon 801, it has the fastest processor out there right now. It terms of real speed, I cannot say if it is faster than the HTC One m8 or the Sony Xperia Z2, but it is definitely up there. When you touch an app icon to launch it, it launches nearly instantly. To really see how this phone flies, just open the gallery app and scroll through all your photos and you'll see what I mean. Usually the gallery is where most phones stutter as it tries to load all your photos and albums - but NOT the S5!* The Camera - FINALLY! Samsung has decided to make a decent camera, and not just as an afterthought. This 16mp camera is really awesome, so much better than the S4. I would always get washed out images with my S3/S4/Note 2, but with the S5, it actually looks like it's from a decent point-and-shoot dedicated camera with crisp, bright, and saturated images. Low-light shooting is also vastly improved, although not as good as the new HTC One m8. 16mp means 5312 x 2988 -resolution images, so you can actually blow them up or crop them down without fearing the dreaded pixelation monster. There are a myriad of other cool and useful camera features that I will save for you to find out(like macro and Google Street View modes :]). And lastly, the focus is quick, quick, QUICK! Nearly instantaneous focus allows you to capture those hard-to-capture moments easier. A definitely thumbs up to Samsung for paying attention to the camera and its functions.* Software - I'm still trying to figure out everything, as there is A LOT of stuff under the hood. Samsung's TouchWiz user interface this time around is A LOT less intrusive though, as much as can be without being totally stock Android, I guess. The layout and iconography are flatter and simpler, and for the better in my view. There is also a new sensor on the back, just beneath the camera lens. It is a heart-rate monitor/pedometer, and it comes with its own health app called S Health. There is a new battery-saving mode which can save you precious minutes when you're caught in a bind. All in all, I think this version is a lot nicer-looking, more responsive, and better than the precious S phones.The ultimate question is whether this phone is a worthy upgrade over the S4. As my review title suggests, it is an evolution, an incremental upgrade over the S4. So with that said I cannot whole-heartedly recommend it if you already have a good phone, or even over the S4. But I do feel this upgrade is more vast and much better than from the S3 to the S4, so in that sense Samsung has done a much better job this year. If you are switching from an older phone that was made at least 2 years ago, then I would tell you jump right in and try the S5 - it will not disappoint you. But for those with already a good phone, and/or say you just finished year one of your 2-year contract, then I would say think hard before you make the leap. For my money, I think the Note 4 and S6 will be the bigger upgrades more worth waiting for.",4/9/14,1

184940,"Quality, performance and optimization at its finest",Juan A.,R16ERU29U20NQO,"After a month of use of the phone, I can resume it in few words, in case you don't wanna read the full review: The phone is built in excellent quality materials, has an excellent performance and the optimization of the components and software makes it last enough during the day so you won't need to carry a charger with you. If the camera is not a primary need for you, this is an excellent phone and I'd recommend it to anyone.Now if you're interested in a deeper review, here we go.-DesignThe HTC One M8 is, at least in my opinion, one of the best crafted android phones out there, the quality of the materials which is built can be noticed without even touch it, and once you have it in your hand the phone gives the feeling of a premium device, just what you're paying for, since it's not cheap at all.The sleek full aluminum body costs its price in the weight of the phone though, making it one of the heaviest smartphones out there, only comparable with the Sony Xperia Z2; I previously had a Galaxy S4, which is supposed to be way more lighter due to the materials difference, however in my personal experience it's really hard to have a S4 without a case and keep it intact, the plastic can be easily scratched and the material is a fingerprints magnet, so the weight it gains in favor of lighter materials, ends up being gained again for the case. After using the M8 for a month I can say the materials are good enough to not get scratches for normal use, and fingerprints are out of discussion.As a negative point I'd say as many others, the space in the front of the logo is completely unnecessary and only adds some dead height to the phone, however you can still navigate through all of the screen with a hand in most of situations with ease.In my personal opinion, the decision about putting the power button in the top at the phone is more than accurate, I lost count on how many times I turned screen on with my previous phone while I was putting in into the pocket cause I accidentally touched the button on the edge while holding it, this combined with the gestures to unlock the screen makes you forget about the lock button, which not makes it uncomfortable in the end.-ScreenThe M8 screen it's a beautiful screen, I was a bit worried about this cause I was used to the AMOLED displays from Samsung, but once used this one for a while I should say, in my personal opinion is way more better, because color saturation is more accurate to natural tones, except for some green tones, I don't know if it's because all of the time I've spent with AMOLED screens, but they seem way bright in the M8 screen, the first time was uncomfortable and still don't like how do they seem at all. An example of these green tones are present in the google play store in the apps and games buttons, I'll add some images later from the phone so you can appreciate it.In terms of brightness the M8 has a good brightness scale: the lowest brightness is enough to light the screen while you're reading in the dark without being annoying, and the highest one is too bright for my personal like in normal light situations (cause I don't like high brightness in my screens anyway) but it's enough to be able to watch the content of the screen against direct sunlight, which I appreciate a lot considering in the same conditions with my previous phone I was just able to see some purple brights most of the time.The automatic brightness could be improved later, looks so close to the highest brightness for my personal likes.-CameraThis was one of the things that kept me skeptical about the phone cause I heard a lot of complains about the first HTC One and the Ultra Pixel technology, so I was expecting ugly and blurry photos. I'm not a huge fan of photos and I don't take a lot of them with the phone, maybe I'm not the best person to make a review from it, but the ones I've taken seems fair enough for me, the colors are good, the camera is fast and results are decent. Off course, it has the limitations of what every 4 pixel camera (being ultra or mega pixel) could have, and it's the lack of detail and sharpness as soon as you start zooming the photo. However if you're gonna take pics just for selfies, casual food hipster photos and to send some images from whatsapp or facebook (which in whatsapp case are resized anyway) the quality of the photos are good enough, there is very detailed reviews about this at Internet if you need more info about it.Duo camera bring some interesting effects, some more polished than others, the most interesting for many people, ufocus, actually works, but it's not the most polished of them, I have to say in some situations the area is not well defined, but for general purpose will behave as you expect most of times.If it's true more mega pixels doesn't fully means a better camera, it's also true this one still lacks of the minimum required amount of pixels to be at pair with his competitors, I hope they find a way to add more pixels to the camera, this would make cover the weakest point of this phone.-AudioThis topic is with no doubt one of the shiniest for HTC, last year's One was way more ahead from the rest, and this year they've done it again. Frontal double speakers sacrifices some height from the phone, making it as tall as other with bigger screens, but the sound quality is out of discussion. This year Sony got close by bringing their speaker to the front as well which improved the audio, but I think HTC is still better, and I've seen some serious audio reviews which also thinks so, but in the end it's a personal preference, none of them are perfect.-Memory and BatterySince I was using the S4, I've never been able to fill up the memory, cause I tend to close what I'm not using, I'm not the most memory demanding user over there. If you feel like fitting in my profile, 2GB of RAM should be enough for you, and maybe most of people, since in the end few manufacturers gave the jump into the 3GB scale. I've been using around 10 apps in the background with no weird behaviors, everything works as expected.Before talking about battery duration let's define my usage patterns: daily usage includes web browsing, reading books and news, checking mail, social networks and sometimes playing some 3D games, which makes me a kind of heavy user.The battery was one of the things that impressed me more from this phone. My previous phone had a 2600 mAh, which used to last in average more than 3 and less than 4 hours of screen on before battery runs out, sometimes I was close to the 4 hours, in terms of hours without having to charge the phone that meant 8-10 hours on the heaviest use I gave it, 12 average and having power saving options on except for processor one, 14-16 on light use and around 20 hours using power saving additional options, being that the record I got with that phone.The HTC One M8 comes with a 2600 mAh battery too, in terms of screen on hours before the battery runs out, it lasts in average more than 5 hours and less than 6 and I've passed the 6 hours sometimes. In terms of hours without charging the phone, that's around 14 hours on heavy usage, 16-24 hours on lighter usage and up to 40 hours on weekends when I use the phone the less, without using any power saving option, and being my current record on this one. This 'no power savings' statement is a bit tricky though, cause the HTC One M8 turns power saving settings automatically when battery is lower than 15%, however if you consider my previous phone had them always on, it's a huge step forward for the same battery capacity, and this is where the optimization from title comes from.-SoftwareHTC sense is extremely non intrusive personalization layer,is fast, fluid and minimalist. The applications have these same patterns and tend to add some color to the equation (not so many for application though) this can be a good or bad thing, that depends on your likes, I'll add some screenshots of the apps later. I won't add benchmarks test to talk about performance cause they've been tricked some generations ago, but in normal use around this month I haven't experienced any heavy lag, or delay which makes the phone uncomfortable to use. The phone is fast, you can feel the difference between the sanpdragon 600 and the 800 series, it executes everything smoothly.Saying there's a phone with no lag at all anytime is a beautiful lie, I've seen random lags, freezes and delays even in iPhones; this is not the perfect phone, however they barely happen, at least with the time I've been using it and with the usage I've been making of it, you can't compare it to TouchWiz, that's miles ahead in terms of lag and delay competition, even if that's not a good thing.A real downside and a bad thing of this non intrusive UI I've found is, however, the lack of a default file explorer. Android doesn't has any, and HTC won't include anyone either. If you don't use a SD card in your phone that won't be any deal, you just need to pick the one you like more from the Play Store (there are a lot, with beautiful and polished UI and a lot of people make their default from there anyway), but if you have a SD card this will mean some problems and uncomfortable situations for you; since Android 4.4 Google restricted the SD card write access to only Google apps and the third party applications installed by the manufacturer, so not having a preset one or a google provided one, you won't be able to modify anything from the SD card without connecting the phone to a PC. This can be solved with root privileges, but if you understand what that means and the consequences it has, you'll understand that's a decision you need to make and prolly HTC won't like it if you need to claim your warranty.-MiscellaneousSomething I didn't like from this phone and I liked more from my previous one that it's not covered in everywhere else, is the notification LED. This one has only 3 colors: red when battery's low, green when it's fully charged, and an orange-like for everything else; maybe there's a setting to change this, or you could use an third party application for it, but so far I haven't found any setting.-ConclusionThe HTC One M8 is an excellent piece of engineering, nicely crafted with a good performance and optimization, which however has some flaws that can be improved, some by software, and some will need to be taken in consideration, hopefully, for the next generation's model, and if you're reading the conclusion after reading the review, we can conclude you're a very patient person :)Thanks for your time, hope this turns out to be helpful for you!",5/28/14,1

I did however have a bad experience with one of the vendors but Amozon handled that no problems.  I used Tailwind and received 2 BRAND NEW un-molested factory boxed 820's.Thank you Amazon for unrivaled customer service!,5/17/14,1
172386,Can't beat it for the price,turbomatic,RF65QLQ760OKA,"Bought this for my 15 year old son about six months ago as his first legit smart phone. Not one regret. No crappy overlays from service providers or Motorola--stock android that works like its supposed to. No 4G service, but it doesn't suck battery like 4G phones generally do, so I consider this a good trade off. The screen is really good--extremely bright (brighter than my HTC One) and sharp. Batterly life and call quality are excellent. Processing speed is nice and zippy. Only drawback is the camera--it's pretty bad. Otherwise, a great phone with no strings attached. After six months it works as it did on day one, after having tons of apps installed and uninstalled. Never had to do a hard reset or anything.",5/29/14,1

184941,Best Phone I have ever owned,Kendall,R2ZNRU9FB21604,"I recently got an upgrade with Verizon, I hated my Iphone with a passion. So I switched over to an HTC, I have no regret! Everything about this phone is great! on top of that it looks professional.Battery Life:I recently had an iPhone, the battery life was absolutely horrid. I couldn't make it pasted one in the afternoon without needed a charge. But now I can make it through about a day, day and a half! HUGE improvement. It also has a Lithium battery which has a high charge density which means a longer life.Camera:Are you a phone-photographer? Well if you buy this phone you are sure to become one! the HTC One M8 has not one, but two rear cameras. HTC calls it a Duo camera. The main lens sports a 4 megapixel (1520â€†Ã—â€†2688) UltraPixel sensor with an f/2.0 aperture and a pixel size of 2.0 micrometers. The secondary lens is there for just gathering information about depth. And instead on focusing on just the megapixel count and more on the size and quality of the pixels.BoomSound:I constantly listen to Sound Cloud, Pandora, and 8tracks. So when I heard that the HTC one M8 had built in amps I was ecstatic. Plus the M8 is 25 percent louder than before. The volume level easily beat the iPhone 5S, Galaxy S4 or Lumia 1020. The HTC One M8 has one massive .85cc top speaker chamber and .80cc bottom speaker chamber size. It's great for watching movies and YouTube.Size:Yes it is a Phablet (phone tablet) which means it has a bigger type of screen, Its about two times the size of my old iPhone 4s. I like it because its clear, handy, and the graphics are really nice. It is a 5inch screen along with a 441 ppi pixel density. The good thing about this phone is that its slightly big but not to big and its pixels are pretty amazing. Also includes a muilti touch sensitivity.Portability (size / weight):Has a good amount of weight to it that I really enjoy. It's kind of a larger phone but I really like it. Its not excessively heavy either. I haven't yet noticed a weight change since my trade in with my iPhone.  It's slim build and light weight make it easy to carry and use. Especially for the 5inch screen it has!Summary:All together I love the new HTC one M8, Its battery life is so much better, its camera fits my needs, and the BoomSound is amazing. I recommend this phone to anyone, whether you are working constantly or just like to play games. I cant find anything I dont like about this phone.",5/24/14,1

177963,I Couldn't Be Happier,Shaun Nixon,R34P13VCE0T9KN,"I was looking for a new phone and I had certain criteria in mind:It had to have a modern operating system - Android or iOSIt had to have a quad core cpuit had to have more than 512mb ramit had to have a battery that could be removed unlike an iPhonefinally - It had to be AFFORDABLE and UNLOCKEDI saw this Blu Life One L120 on Amazon and started to research it.This phone has an aluminium middle housing for strength.It has a quadcore processor and 1 mb of ram.The glass is Gorilla Glass and extremely toughThe phone was ordered on April 24th and arrived on April 28th with PrimeIt came with a screen protector, a rubber case, charger, and headphones.I bought a replacement cover that I preferred, from Amazon.The phone seems well constructed, the battery cover is easy to remove and Sim card and micro SD easy to insert.I bought a Net 10 $40 per month Sim and Airtime card from Best Buy.I am using the ATT network and seem to have decent coverage, even in rural Maine.The phone came installed with Android Jelly Bean, upgradeable to Kit Kat (one of the reasons I chose this phone).I tried to update it but it seems the update to Kit Kat is available sometime in May, 2014.I've installed several apps and all seems to be working well.One of the apps I installed is called Gravity Screen - it allows me to bring the phone out of sleep mode by simply turning it over.One of the great features of this phone is Google Now which is similar to Siri.  It has many features I can send a text message or email simply by asking my phone to do it.  I can also get directions, set a reminder on my calendar and a whole host of other features.Overall I am extremely satisfied with this phone.  I initially wanted the phone to be slightly smaller but it is perfect.The screen has what seems like a much brighter, clearer image than my wife's iphone 4 s.",5/17/14,1
151406,Love this phone,Kimberly A. Bettes,R1HUK8BKLW4S4D,"I'm a big 'no contract' person, and I've been a Tracfone and net10 user since I first got a cell phone over 12 years ago. Recently I decided to upgrade to a smartphone and I bought the Net10 ZTE Illustra. HUGE mistake. That thing only had like 150 MB of internal memory, so when I took it out of the packaging, it downloaded updates and was immediately full. It wouldn't let me transfer anything to the memory card either. I returned that sucker immediately and bought this. Though I hate Windows 8 for a computer, it's fantastic for a phone or tablet. This phone is absolutely wonderful. There are a couple of drawbacks which aren't a huge problem for me but might be for someone else (there's no front-facing camera, there isn't a huge choice of apps - can't get goodreads, can only get Instagram Beta, can't get my local newststation's weather app, etc.). What really drew me to this phone was that it clearly stated on the package that it has 8 GB of internal memory and is upgradeable to 64 GB via microSD card. The screen is vivid, the phone easy to use. I could tell immediately that this phone was better than the other 'smart phones' offered by no-contract companies because of the heft of it. The camera is 5 MP, which I use a lot. It takes fantastic photos. And videos. Great phone. I highly recommend it.",5/8/14,1

124440,BLU Tank Phone,Pat Williams bunny foofoo,R1JPWTF1RQG1N5,"This is a simple phone in that you can put phone numbers in and call people which is my major use for it.  It does a lot ofdifferent applications that as yet I am not fully knowledgeable about but also things that I don't need it for.  I was interested in a simple phone and that is why I ordered this one.  It is small (cute), easy to use for what my needs are and has a camera and a flashlight neither of which I have used yet.  It will play FM stations on it for a total of 4 hours though I have not used it for that long.  One of the best things about it is the length of time the battery lasts.  So far it has lasted for 2 weeks without recharging and I have talked on it for at least  2 and 1/2 or more hours and the battery does not show any use. It uses SIM cards to collect your stored information and has slots for 2 of them.

183623,An absolutely fantastic phone,Jared Trigili,RTG5HMRLLM7XM,"If you've done any research about the Galaxy S5 yet, you probably found at least a few people claiming that it has very few improvements from the Galaxy S4. I can honestly say that this is not the case, and that, coming from a Galaxy S4, this is probably the best decision I could have made for an upgrade.The screen alone, if not anything else, makes the product worth buying, is critically acclaimed and has been praised as the best consumer screen available by Displaymate, a long-running display reviewer.The back has also received some negative buzz; if you've ever held the first generation Nexus 7, it's very similar to that. Personally I find that it makes holding the device much easier, and combined with Samsung's build-in One-handed Mode, the device is as convenient as ever. Ergonomically speaking, this device beats the HTC One (M8) in just about every aspect, as the M8 that I was playing with slipped out of my hands and onto the table a total of three times, at which point I had to rest it on a surface and use it like that.Samsung also included their USB 3.0 charging port on the device which comes with a special cable, but the port was made so that it can support typical Micro-USB cables as well.The camera is also out of this world, and though it takes some getting used to navigating around the different options and modes available, I think you will be impressed with how quickly it is able to focus on a subject. If you create a Samsung account, you also have other camera modes available for download from the Samsung store, some of which are somewhat gimmicky, others are pretty neat. To date, these include Animated Photo (essentially a GIF creator), Sequence shot (a slow motion viewer), Surround shot (which creates a spherical panorama), Sound & Shot (which adds a few seconds of sound to a still photo, actually kinda neat), and Sports shot (which takes pictures of fast moving objects). All of these are free, by the way, which is really cool. As of writing this review more may have been added!Using the device is super snappy and quick, and going back to my old phone I don't know how I ever survived! Only one app has ever force closed on me while using my S5, and that app was in beta so it's difficult to tell whether it was the phone or the app itself. The IR remote is also pretty cool, and the app The Off Button is recommended because it outputs every TV IR code in a sequence so your device can act as a universal off remote. Perfect for turning off loud TV's at the bar! I've also used it to remotely trigger my DSLR, a Pentax K-30, with the app Camera Remote, which also works great!All in all, there's a lot to be praised about this phone, and I intend on keeping it around for a while!",5/19/14,1

It's full-featured, lightweight and reliable. The camera and video are good, and I'm enjoying the 4G speed (since I used to have slow 3G) from Virgin Mobile.

No 4G service, but it doesn't suck battery like 4G phones generally do, so I consider this a good trade off. The screen is really good--extremely bright (brighter than my HTC One) and sharp. Batterly life and call quality are excellent. Processing speed is nice and zippy. Only drawback is the camera--it's pretty bad. Otherwise, a great phone with no strings attached. After six months it works as it did on day one, after having tons of apps installed and uninstalled. Never had to do a hard reset or anything.",5/29/14,1

169256,This phone is a must have,Kathy T.,R1QQSQM784NN15,I do not struggle with more complicated phones but wanted something that was more simple to use. The display is the best on the market. The sound is good but it would have been nice if it could go a bit louder. Battery life lasts me throughout the day with one charge every night. It's extremely fast and has high speed internet capabilities. I even loved the design. However I would buy it straight from google because it is cheaper. I purchased the black case from google and it works good with the wireless charger they have. I strongly reccomend the invisishield screen protector. Oh and I forgot to mention this does not come loaded with all those carrier apps,5/1/14,1

168195,After Several Months I Still Love this Phone,Rick Digital Crazy,R1BSHDYBUP0WH0,"Wow, where do I start?  Although I didn't buy my Z30 through Amazon (it was sold out when I was shopping) I got it from Verizon.  My biggest fear was if the phone would be too big.  It's not.  In fact it's only slightly bigger than the Z10 it replaced which now seems kind of small to me.The best part of this device is the battery life.  I used to worry about making it through the day with all of my other phones (I've owned quite a few).  With the Z30 I no longer need to bring battery boosters and chargers with me during the day.  In fact it can last well over 30+ hours.  The wireless charging is a great feature; just drop the phone onto a little pad and the phone starts charging.The elegance and simplicity of the BB10 OS is very underrated and misunderstood.  Once you get past the swiping up from the bottom to minimize and close apps, you are set.  The swipe to the right to get to the Hub (all of your emails and notifications) followed by a swipe to the left to go back to your apps is so simple I find it unbelievable that anyone can think this OS is complicated.  What is complicated is trying to figure out how to close an app on an iPhone.There are some unexpected things like the great stereo speakers and the HDMI out port that you can get a cable for less than $5 here on Amazon to send everything on your phone to your flat screen TV in full HD.  And wireless with Miracast (although I haven't tried that yet).Now that I can upload all of the Android apps that were missing from BlackBerry World, I've got the best of both of those worlds.  What isn't to like?I highly recommend this phone.  It is the best piece of hardware I've ever picked up.",5/15/14,1

During the purchase process, I just gave the Amazon website my cellphone number, and it checked that I was eligible for upgrade, and it was done.  Simple.  The Verizon store will still help with any issues or set up if needed.  Love the phone.  Great camera, the sound quality is excellent.  Battery life is far superior to my old Motorola Bionic.

I have had this gem for just about a month now and my only concerns are very trivial. I would say this phone is 98.9% 5 star worthy. My only concern has been the need for an extra long mini USB, but if you don't move it too much it works on a normal one, the back cover is a bit thin, and the speaker can be a little quiet on some but not all calls.I use this phone on Straight Talk's network. I can download apps in seconds, peruse the internet with no qualms, and the battery life is decent for a phone that can run so much at a time.I am so happy with this phone I plan on buying another for my fiance, or one just like it!Thanks!",5/3/14,1

178984,A dedicated charging station that is not my laptop,Jimmy Godard,RIJOI49OYOV8O,"This is a new charger in my collection of chargers. What does separate this charger from the rest? At first, I thought this was like any others. Then, I realized some cool features about the charger. It is not just a hub of USB ports, but it allows you to charge: 5 ports (5V / 8A total) power maximum-speed charges up to 2 iPad Air (2.4A max), 2 iPhones or Android phones (1A max) and one Galaxy Tab simultaneously. One of the features that I like is the label of Samsung Tab on the product. This avoids the plugging of my Samsung Tablet into a lower powered port.In addition, the size is convenient as it fits in the palm of my hand. It is therefore easy to carry with me during my travel. This has become the newest gadget in my business travel bag. I can now leave behind all those A/C cords for each of my electronics.Anyone can benefit from this product. It is small enough that I can bring it into the office to keep my devices charged.Some of the main benefits of this charger are:â€¢  The ability to charge 5 different devices simultaneouslyâ€¢  The size is adequate to support such amount of devices and yet portable for the office, at home, vacation, and travel.â€¢  I can now quintupled one A/C receptacle at the airport. This is awesome.â€¢  My laptop is no longer a charging stationâ€¢  My family uses some of my other chargers, as Iâ€™ve claimed this oneI would love to see an improvement of a light indicator to state that the power is on. I guess the manufacture expects you to turn on your power adapterïÅ_.",5/29/14,1

This phone was like a huge breath of fresh air for her. Didn't take me long to get her acquainted with Windows Phone as it's a very user friendly mobile OS. She's now Facebook messaging and texting/calling relatives overseas with Viber like a pro. Since I got this phone as a mother's day gift (gave my dad an old Lumia 710 running WP 7.8 I had laying around so he wouldn't feel left out), I changed my family's T-mobile plan to include data on all lines; $100 for 4 numbers with unlimited talk, text, and web.

169951,Best smart phone yet! Apple who??,Scotty S. ss_imaging,R2EY59WENWGVWM,"I love the big screen real estate which is super sharp and vibrant, no screen defects, phone is sturdy and tight, strong build!I love the fact its comes with a massive 32gb internal memory and you can drop and drag all types of media files to it without going through a program, thats what killed the iphone for me, the simplicity of media swapping..Also unlike the iphone, the note 3 does real multi tasking.. i can watch a video(music/movie or show) and at the same time browse the internet/facebook or instagram! Its like a pocket computer!!Android is still the best.. if you want a compact, small/simple underpowered smart phone which does only simple things.. get a iphone, but if you want a powerful multitasking/multimedia super power phone get this one!

185015,"Quality, performance and optimization at its finest",Juan A.,R16ERU29U20NQO,"After a month of use of the phone, I can resume it in few words, in case you don't wanna read the full review: The phone is built in excellent quality materials, has an excellent performance and the optimization of the components and software makes it last enough during the day so you won't need to carry a charger with you. If the camera is not a primary need for you, this is an excellent phone and I'd recommend it to anyone.Now if you're interested in a deeper review, here we go.-DesignThe HTC One M8 is, at least in my opinion, one of the best crafted android phones out there, the quality of the materials which is built can be noticed without even touch it, and once you have it in your hand the phone gives the feeling of a premium device, just what you're paying for, since it's not cheap at all.The sleek full aluminum body costs its price in the weight of the phone though, making it one of the heaviest smartphones out there, only comparable with the Sony Xperia Z2; I previously had a Galaxy S4, which is supposed to be way more lighter due to the materials difference, however in my personal experience it's really hard to have a S4 without a case and keep it intact, the plastic can be easily scratched and the material is a fingerprints magnet, so the weight it gains in favor of lighter materials, ends up being gained again for the case. After using the M8 for a month I can say the materials are good enough to not get scratches for normal use, and fingerprints are out of discussion.As a negative point I'd say as many others, the space in the front of the logo is completely unnecessary and only adds some dead height to the phone, however you can still navigate through all of the screen with a hand in most of situations with ease.In my personal opinion, the decision about putting the power button in the top at the phone is more than accurate, I lost count on how many times I turned screen on with my previous phone while I was putting in into the pocket cause I accidentally touched the button on the edge while holding it, this combined with the gestures to unlock the screen makes you forget about the lock button, which not makes it uncomfortable in the end.-ScreenThe M8 screen it's a beautiful screen, I was a bit worried about this cause I was used to the AMOLED displays from Samsung, but once used this one for a while I should say, in my personal opinion is way more better, because color saturation is more accurate to natural tones, except for some green tones, I don't know if it's because all of the time I've spent with AMOLED screens, but they seem way bright in the M8 screen, the first time was uncomfortable and still don't like how do they seem at all. An example of these green tones are present in the google play store in the apps and games buttons, I'll add some images later from the phone so you can appreciate it.In terms of brightness the M8 has a good brightness scale: the lowest brightness is enough to light the screen while you're reading in the dark without being annoying, and the highest one is too bright for my personal like in normal light situations (cause I don't like high brightness in my screens anyway) but it's enough to be able to watch the content of the screen against direct sunlight, which I appreciate a lot considering in the same conditions with my previous phone I was just able to see some purple brights most of the time.The automatic brightness could be improved later, looks so close to the highest brightness for my personal likes.-CameraThis was one of the things that kept me skeptical about the phone cause I heard a lot of complains about the first HTC One and the Ultra Pixel technology, so I was expecting ugly and blurry photos. I'm not a huge fan of photos and I don't take a lot of them with the phone, maybe I'm not the best person to make a review from it, but the ones I've taken seems fair enough for me, the colors are good, the camera is fast and results are decent. Off course, it has the limitations of what every 4 pixel camera (being ultra or mega pixel) could have, and it's the lack of detail and sharpness as soon as you start zooming the photo. However if you're gonna take pics just for selfies, casual food hipster photos and to send some images from whatsapp or facebook (which in whatsapp case are resized anyway) the quality of the photos are good enough, there is very detailed reviews about this at Internet if you need more info about it.Duo camera bring some interesting effects, some more polished than others, the most interesting for many people, ufocus, actually works, but it's not the most polished of them, I have to say in some situations the area is not well defined, but for general purpose will behave as you expect most of times.If it's true more mega pixels doesn't fully means a better camera, it's also true this one still lacks of the minimum required amount of pixels to be at pair with his competitors, I hope they find a way to add more pixels to the camera, this would make cover the weakest point of this phone.-AudioThis topic is with no doubt one of the shiniest for HTC, last year's One was way more ahead from the rest, and this year they've done it again. Frontal double speakers sacrifices some height from the phone, making it as tall as other with bigger screens, but the sound quality is out of discussion. This year Sony got close by bringing their speaker to the front as well which improved the audio, but I think HTC is still better, and I've seen some serious audio reviews which also thinks so, but in the end it's a personal preference, none of them are perfect.-Memory and BatterySince I was using the S4, I've never been able to fill up the memory, cause I tend to close what I'm not using, I'm not the most memory demanding user over there. If you feel like fitting in my profile, 2GB of RAM should be enough for you, and maybe most of people, since in the end few manufacturers gave the jump into the 3GB scale. I've been using around 10 apps in the background with no weird behaviors, everything works as expected.Before talking about battery duration let's define my usage patterns: daily usage includes web browsing, reading books and news, checking mail, social networks and sometimes playing some 3D games, which makes me a kind of heavy user.The battery was one of the things that impressed me more from this phone. My previous phone had a 2600 mAh, which used to last in average more than 3 and less than 4 hours of screen on before battery runs out, sometimes I was close to the 4 hours, in terms of hours without having to charge the phone that meant 8-10 hours on the heaviest use I gave it, 12 average and having power saving options on except for processor one, 14-16 on light use and around 20 hours using power saving additional options, being that the record I got with that phone.The HTC One M8 comes with a 2600 mAh battery too, in terms of screen on hours before the battery runs out, it lasts in average more than 5 hours and less than 6 and I've passed the 6 hours sometimes. In terms of hours without charging the phone, that's around 14 hours on heavy usage, 16-24 hours on lighter usage and up to 40 hours on weekends when I use the phone the less, without using any power saving option, and being my current record on this one. This 'no power savings' statement is a bit tricky though, cause the HTC One M8 turns power saving settings automatically when battery is lower than 15%, however if you consider my previous phone had them always on, it's a huge step forward for the same battery capacity, and this is where the optimization from title comes from.-SoftwareHTC sense is extremely non intrusive personalization layer,is fast, fluid and minimalist. The applications have these same patterns and tend to add some color to the equation (not so many for application though) this can be a good or bad thing, that depends on your likes, I'll add some screenshots of the apps later. I won't add benchmarks test to talk about performance cause they've been tricked some generations ago, but in normal use around this month I haven't experienced any heavy lag, or delay which makes the phone uncomfortable to use. The phone is fast, you can feel the difference between the sanpdragon 600 and the 800 series, it executes everything smoothly.Saying there's a phone with no lag at all anytime is a beautiful lie, I've seen random lags, freezes and delays even in iPhones; this is not the perfect phone, however they barely happen, at least with the time I've been using it and with the usage I've been making of it, you can't compare it to TouchWiz, that's miles ahead in terms of lag and delay competition, even if that's not a good thing.A real downside and a bad thing of this non intrusive UI I've found is, however, the lack of a default file explorer. Android doesn't has any, and HTC won't include anyone either. If you don't use a SD card in your phone that won't be any deal, you just need to pick the one you like more from the Play Store (there are a lot, with beautiful and polished UI and a lot of people make their default from there anyway), but if you have a SD card this will mean some problems and uncomfortable situations for you; since Android 4.4 Google restricted the SD card write access to only Google apps and the third party applications installed by the manufacturer, so not having a preset one or a google provided one, you won't be able to modify anything from the SD card without connecting the phone to a PC. This can be solved with root privileges, but if you understand what that means and the consequences it has, you'll understand that's a decision you need to make and prolly HTC won't like it if you need to claim your warranty.-MiscellaneousSomething I didn't like from this phone and I liked more from my previous one that it's not covered in everywhere else, is the notification LED. This one has only 3 colors: red when battery's low, green when it's fully charged, and an orange-like for everything else; maybe there's a setting to change this, or you could use an third party application for it, but so far I haven't found any setting.-ConclusionThe HTC One M8 is an excellent piece of engineering, nicely crafted with a good performance and optimization, which however has some flaws that can be improved, some by software, and some will need to be taken in consideration, hopefully, for the next generation's model, and if you're reading the conclusion after reading the review, we can conclude you're a very patient person :)Thanks for your time, hope this turns out to be helpful for you!",5/28/14,1

179375,Great phone for the price,Philip O. Kelly,R1F16J8WLWHGZH,"This phone does everything my nexus 7 tablet does but it's a phone.  I don't understand the complaints about the screen....my screen is fine.  I can see what some people are talking about when you tilt it but I never would have noticed it at all if it wasn't pointed out here. Be ready for a pain in the caboose if you are going to hook it up to straight talk. I am tech savy and it still took a couple hours of messing around and calling their customer service.  Once it finally got all sorted out the thing works like a charm.  One thing, the case that comes with the phone is really just a skin and offers little to no protection.  The kickstand case that is sold on this website is heavy duty though and not expensive.  Well worth the price. In the end ,it is insane what you get with this phone for the price.....just as good as an iphone with the exception of the camera, which is just OK.  Super happy with the purchase",5/5/14,1
